ladies and gentlemen meet renewable

energy pioneer and world Explorer Bethel

Dakar

[Applause]

achieving the first solar flight around

the world

[Music]

this is the story of two men Berthold

pica psychiatrist and Explorer

and Andre Borschberg engineer and

entrepreneur

a team driven by a vision of the future

and a passion for innovation

the first airplane of perpetual

endurance able to fly day and night

without fuel

together with their partners they wanted

to show the power of pioneering spirit

and clean technologies to bring

solutions for a better world Solar

Impulse the adventure showing the change

is possible but there's nothing like

testing we deeply believe that we can

achieve impossible and incredible things

between your pathologies like flying on

the roads with no fuel and if this works

of course everybody can do it on the

ground to make a cleaner world and this

can be your way to be with us in the

plane and this wasn't seen in Abu Dhabi

early

[Music]

between March in July 2015

their topic are can Andre Borschberg flu

without a drop of feel from Abu Dhabi to

Oman across the Arabian Sea to India

Myanmar China Japan and over the Pacific

to Hawaii

[Music]

healing up to all that time you broke a

world record

terms of solo flight

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Applause]

resuming the round-the-world adventure

in April 2016 Solar Impulse continued

from Hawaii to California in New York

across the Atlantic to Spain than Egypt

and made it back successfully to Abu

Dhabi in July

[Music]

today the challenge is no longer to

conquer the moon the challenge is to

conquer quality of life on Earth

our world desperately needs the

implementation of clean technologies to

reduce the energy consumption and the

waste of natural resources

turning final zero - right

[Music]

this airplane was not built to carry

passengers but to carry a message

the world could reduce half of its co2

emissions by replacing old polluting

devices with new clean technologies like

those used on Solar Impulse

[Music]

I am inspired to fire your pioneering

spirit if an airplane like Solar Impulse

can fly day and night without fuel the

world of inspiring generations promoting

innovative solutions to the challenges

of humanity inventing a brighter future

[Music]

solar energy made it possible to fly

many days and nights in a row without

fuel crossing to oceans and remaining

airborne longer than any jet plane in

history 2016 has seen the completion of

this pioneering adventure flying 40,000

kilometers around the world without a

single drop of fuel

[Applause]

[Music]

luxola impulse

the cleantech revolution has taken off

presenting new ways of thinking and

doing to achieve the impossible

and you can be a part of it

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

excellencies ladies and gentlemen good

morning are you aware of what it means

for you to be in this room it means that

you care for the future of our world

that you care for improving quality of

life on Earth

not only for energy but through all the

consequences for the environment for

health for employment for profitability

and clean growth and I admire you for

that now it's clear that the entire

world is not in this room which means

that there is still a lot of work to do

to inspire others to follow our path and

if we want to motivate them we need to

speak their language for very long time

the protection of the environment has

been a threat for mobility for growth

for comfort and it's clear that it has

not encouraged the entire world to

follow that path path so today we have

to speak the language of the people we

want to convince and this is why I

wanted to show this example of Solar

Impulse because when I brought this

vision to the world of aviation 15 years

ago it took five minutes to the

specialist to calculate how much energy

we needed to have a plane flying on

solar power and after five minutes they

told me it's completely impossible why

did we succeed because we changed the

paradigm after five minutes we knew that

the energy from the Sun to fly a plane

around the world day at night was not

enough but if you change the paradigm

you don't work on the energy production

you work on the energy consumption and

after a few years we managed to make a

plane that was energy efficient enough

to use the amount of solar energy during

10 hours in the day run for electrical

models and store the electricity to fly

at night in order to reach the next

sunrise and continue so for the first

time in history there was an airplane of

Perpetual endurance it could fly

theoretically forever because it had no

fuel and it did not need to reflow to

refuel and land if we landed it was just

to change the pilot because it was a

single seater so you see the importance

of changing the paradigm when my

great-grandfather installed the first

telephone in Switzerland at the end of

the 19th century at the end of the 19th

century he had a telephone line from his

office to his house and he invited all

his colleagues professors at the

University of Basel and said hey look I

have something new and he called his

wife from his office and all his

colleagues professors said it's very

funny but it has no future and why that

why that because the paradigm at that

moment was that every house had to be

linked to every other house in the world

even to people you did not know yet

because maybe you would need to form

them in a few years which would make

billions and billions of telephone lines

of course it's impossible but the change

of paradigm was to have a central

connecting the lines from everybody so

one line was enough instead of billion

of lines for computers it was the same

the first computers were big as a house

the change of paradigm to allow us today

to have one computer in each pocket was

the silicon

that increase the efficiency year after

year for the energy transition it's

exactly the same thing we have to

analyze what is the paradigm of today

the people who are fighting against the

energy transition are saying that

renewable energies will never give

enough energy for the world the change

of paradigm is not more energy

production it is more energy efficiency

how can we save energy and if you notice

all the clean technologies that allow to

save energy today are even more

profitable than energy production why

that because you have to understand that

humankind is like in a bathtub with a

leak and instead of solving the leak we

open the tap wide open to add water in

the bathtub it's clear that this is not

profitable what is really profitable is

to link the energy efficiency with

energy production to energy production

so you see that in that sense innovation

is not a new idea

innovation is an old belief an old

paradigm that you leave behind and this

is the process of pioneering of

exploration of innovation don't try to

have a new idea but they'd take the

status quo of today and leave it behind

this is how the energy transition can

become profitable and I don't know if

you've noticed how much we have spoken

of energy how much we have spoken of

environment of climate change in the

side of the problem so usually every

a conference about climate change is

starting exactly the same way with

climate change we have temperature

increase sea level increase tropical

disease coming to Europe and millions of

climatic refugees and that the biggie at

the end what do we see we see that

people are fed up of hearing the

problems they are depressed because the

problem is to be again and they start to

think I don't do anything because I'm

too small to have a result

the leadership today that the world

needs is to bring the solutions to bring

the hope and to bring the vision Germany

has shown the way and I admire a lot

this government for that now in the rest

of the world what do we see we see that

most of the governments are managing the

country instead of leading the country

when you manage what do you do you tell

people what to do on a day to day basis

and the signal that you give is you are

too stupid to understand just do what

you are told and the result today are

the votes in the extremist parties or

the populism people who say you don't

trust us we're going to show you what we

can do for the worst very often this is

why we need leadership the leadership

doesn't tell people what to do it tells

people why to do it

it sets a vision and it explains the

reasons why we should work for it why

maybe we have to make some effort in the

beginning and if you tell people why we

have to do it they will follow if they

will be honored to be trusted and like

this they will reach the success Europe

has done that after the second world war

because the goal

was to reach peace there was a common

vision today peace is taken for granted

maybe it's a mistake to believe peace

can stay forever but at least it's what

people believe today and what is the

vision for Europe what is the vision for

the world not a lot

let's put energy transition let's put

the protection of our future and the

quality of life as the vision for the

world

the people will follow they will make

the effort and they will be happy to

hear what can be achieved this is the

contribution of the Solar Impulse

project we have decided to launch the

World Alliance for efficient solutions

in order to bring within two years 1,000

solutions that are profitable to protect

the environment there are a lot of

solutions everywhere you don't need to

invent them

you have startup OBO big companies you

have institutions or individuals but

they are not heard they are not

understood on one side you have a

start-up in Germany like first selection

who is purifying water with a special

reactor you also have cholesterol on the

other side of the big companies who can

reduce the energy consumption to produce

chlorine by 30% but it's not used in

Europe it's used only in China so we see

how important it is to promote these

solutions to bring people who have

solutions together in order to really

make a change this is the work of

pioneers in the beginning when you are a

pioneer you are taken for somebody

completely crazy and afterwards people

tell you it's obvious this is the fate

of pioneers so let's be pioneers all

together and let's make the energy

transition

something obvious in the future we'll

look back and we will say to offense and

we were here today and we did our job

good luck to all

[Applause]
