excellent only Burke illegally minors

yes and mhmm ladies and gentlemen of the

time to put on your ear

absolution done through the I Mardan

thank you very much for inviting me to

this event it's my pleasure to be here

today and of course the Berlin energy

transition day is in its third year and

has become somewhat of a tradition now

and if we look at the threads of all the

various issues we're discussing we can

also see that in the climate protection

is now something that cuts across all

policy areas and this is well deserved

because climate change takes everyone

all of society for instance it's a

matter for international foreign and

security policy it is one of the key

requirements for making our world more

secure and more peaceful and at the same

time and this is something that we also

felt in Paris and fall in Paris is that

climate change really builds bridges

across different borders continents

philosophies cultures and religions

bridges of understanding and cooperation

at the same time climate protection is

also becoming an indicator of economic

development as well this is very much

true for the emerging economies and

developing countries in which new

technologies pave the way towards

improving people's lives whilst also

respecting the limit of what the

environment can take but it is also true

for industrialized countries in which

entire sectors are reinventing

themselves and in Germany we can see

this particularly in our automotive

industry you know that of course the

automotive industries on of Germany's

most important sectors and has almost

800,000 employees over the past few

years we've come a great step forward

when it comes to generating our

electricity in a climate friendly way

and by now renewable energies have

become the most important source of our

energy if we look at our transport

sector however we find that we are very

much at the beginning of developing

greenhouse gas neutral mobility so our

question must be how can I actually

should ensure that German cars will be

powered by renew

Germany has had somewhat of a tradition

of looking at alternatives drives in a

with a more skeptical view and I don't

think I'm telling you a secret when I'm

saying that the immobility is not really

have not really made it in in Germany's

cars but at the same time we also know

that alternative drives are extremely

come can be extremely competitive a

plug-in hybrids are paying off and

altogether electric drives are becoming

more competitive last year more than

half a million electric cars was sold it

was sold in China and in Norway almost

twenty-five percent of cars are either

electric cars or plug-in hybrid so I

don't think the question really is

whether carbon free cars will really be

the dominant mode of transport in our

transport system but when this will be

the case and when conventional drives

will be in the museum's so the

automotive sector is well to be

overhauled and is quite fascinating

what's happening at the automotive

industries if you want to gain an

impression of how climate friendly

technologies are developing in our

society and transforming our society and

our economy then have a look at this

German automotive industry we also have

to look at the financial markets more

and more investors and this includes

state and private investment as

decarbonizing day investments this

includes the Norwegian state fund and

the Rockefeller Foundation which of

course used to earn their money with oil

and many insurance companies are now

doing the same so there's a clear trend

towards making climate change part of

your company's strategy the reason for

this is not so much that most of the

upper management in these sectors would

be made up of climate activists no these

are decisions that have steeped an

economic reason that simply reflect the

future of our economy ladies and

gentlemen we've already started to wave

goodbye

to coal oil and gas and the Paris

agreement is a clear commitment by the

international community to an economy

that is greenhouse gas neutral and that

becomes word by the end of the century

but Paris of course was not the target

Paris was the beginning and now we need

to ask ourselves what we are what are we

going to do now the first question is

the following policymakers have to give

clear and reliable signals this is the

only way that enterprises investors and

consumers will be able to make long-term

decisions and this means that states

must really deliver on what they

promised in Paris they need to put this

into practice at home and this means

that industrialized countries need to

support other countries back are not

really able to make this transition on

their own it also means that we all need

to close ranks when there are individual

states that put or call the agreement

into question and rest assured that

Germany and the European Union will do

this in any case security that allows

people to plan this means that we need

to develop long-term strategies at

national level in Germany we have out

when our climate protection plans for

2050 and I've realized that there is a

great deal of international interest in

this plan in Germany we have looked at

or developed sector specific targets for

individual sectors these will be applied

by 2030 which is an intermedium step up

to 2050 so individual sectors will be

assigned some emission with allowances

if you will this also shows that we have

a major task for the next 13 years we

want of course to reach our long term

goal of cutting our greenhouse gas

emissions by ninety-five percent by 2050

compared to 1990 now that green energy

is marketable and that it is able to

compete on the market we need to focus

not only on the electricity sector the

power sector but also in other areas

I've already spoken about transport and

we have a similar effort before us when

comes to buildings and construction in

particularly where heating and cooling

is concerned because heating and cooling

accounts for about one side of the

energy we use across the world and

secondly of course policymakers need to

make sure that we pave the way now that

we create the right incentive for change

and this means that we need to look at

our subsidies and see whether they harm

the climate that if they do so we need

to abolish them we need to act as an

exemplary way the public sector needs to

be exemplary when it comes to investing

in climate friendly portfolios and of

course many municipality from Germany

already doing so 90 billion US dollars

that's the amount of investment that we

need to invest across the globe in

renewing our infrastructure this

includes the energy transport and

building and construction sectors so let

us use these investments to make sure

that they are climate friendly this

includes public transport modern energy

grid energy efficient buildings these

are all areas that have long investment

cycles and this is why we need to really

take a long-term approach to these areas

then there's a third answer to the

question of what we need to do now we

need to make sure that the transition

towards a society that has greenhouse

gas neutral is supported by everyone

that we get everyone on board because we

won't be able to win this race against

global warming unless we get it unless

we have everyone on board and unless we

stop this inequality in the world and

words if we create new inequality we

need to make sure that we get the

developing countries on board as well

and emerging economies let's take the

example of electricity at the moment

rising electricity prices hit those the

most the vessel really don't have money

to live on in the first place and of

course affordable electricity is part of

a very basic public service and we must

not forget this when we make the

transition towards renewables Mendes

change which will of course be caused by

the decarbonizing of our economy it is

true that we need to create the right

framework for climate friendly growth

but at the same time we must not forget

those people whose jobs depend on fossil

fuels so my goal for germany for

instance is to make sure that the

phase-out of lignite will happen in

consensus with the reasons affected with

the company's affected and employers we

want to create new structures to replace

the old ones ladies and gentlemen

climate change and there can be no

question about that is a driver for

innovation and job search and it is a

massive modernization program for our

economy and it is a massive program for

modernization and of course this

modernization has to happen in a way

that is socially just we need a just

transition I'm drunk and as I said at

the beginning we are at the beginning of

a very long road and we should not

pretend that we know all the answers

already of course the way towards

greenhouse gas neutrality won't be easy

and it won't be straight sometimes we

will do a little meandering and

sometimes we'll make mistakes and maybe

in 20 years time we'll talk about

technologies that we don't even know

about today and of course we will also

have to learn to adapt to the

unavoidable impact of climate change so

we in the midst of a massive learning

curve so let us make sure that we are

bold enough to learn from one another

and Germany's wants to make use of this

g20 presidency to create a lot of

opportunities for dialogue we want to to

ensure that people understand that

investing in climate protection is

inventing and prosperity we have a

commissioned a study from the OECD that

really looks into this in a very

scientific way and the title of the

study is investing in climate investing

in growth and we expect the results to

be ready in time for Petersburg climate

dialogue in May and this study will then

also form the basis of the

deliberations at the g20 summit in

Hamburg our goal is to create a joint

plan for action for the climate for

energy and growth ladies and gentlemen

as you can see there's still a lot to

talk about for us and this is the spirit

in which i wish you root for a dialogue

maybe we can see each other again next

year thank
