honest lesbian land and a base from so

many country has a static at random or

Africa to pay for sector creation and

the Parliament excellency Sigma Garfield

yes it's right over here and it's great

to be back here in the Foreign Office

and Sigma great to be hosted here again

it's the third time that we are holding

this conference and see theme of this

conference reliable affordable and

reliable and full shift to a renewable

energy system that is still an urgent

issue and this is why I am sure we will

meet here again next year as well global

interest in successfully transforming

our energy supply assistance is steadily

increasing and so you've come here from

around the world which emphasizes this

fact so great have your handeln to share

in our dialogue welcome again the Paris

climate agreement ladies and gentlemen

was a huge success but we now must not

sit back and relax we need to now have

energy systems that are almost because a

low-carbon at the same time we may have

to make sure that they are secure and

affordable investment in energy means

long-term investment and disinvestment

expensive so in order to make the shift

to a new energy this from affordable

many countries are now adopting

long-term energy strategies that means

that they're defining targets for their

own country and they are also thinking

about how they

can also adopt funding systems so the

Berlin energy transition dialogue is

about discussing how we can launch this

process with transformation so it's

about best practice it's about looking

at the best examples looking at what

works and we also need to think about

how we can use solar energy wind energy

and then feed it into the grid because

there are now more than a couple of

countries around the world where the

emission system accounts for more than

10 where with an energy wind energy

comes for more than ten percent in their

energy system that's in Germany but also

in the north of China but also in the

southwest of India and all this means

that all these countries are faced with

the challenge of feeding volatile and

fluctuating amount of energy into the

grid this means that it's good to engage

in dialogue and share best practices so

in the coming days we wanted to make

Berlin the capital of the global energy

transition and we wanted to make a clear

commitment ladder for instance a

commitment to pursuing a multilateral

approach einheit and to meet there

examine our human clean my prodigious

common energy and climate policy goals

Wulfgar mighty badminton lady to let the

woman is as policymakers and fatigue and

governor human must make sure to provide

you all the right framework for

triggering the necessary investor

innovations in energy and climate

probability member dingleman license and

I think that we should focus on the

following principles the first person i

stationed in her in Exodus means that we

wanted in victorville calif enjoyed

living constantly decrease license the

demand for energy in all secular Exynos

at the same time you also want to

promote the direct use of renewable

energy sources are not only using London

it for generating electricity but also

for generating heat at the point is we

are balling and thirdly Noah only one

day the use of electricity from

renewable protein also and the heat in

the transport and industrial sector

dualshock spectral admit I'm in order to

confer the link up industrial by

accessing sectors of our economy and

that's at Sigma Gamma transit visa to

apply or initiators fabric Sigma God

will pass away for this and I will not

feel tremendously self it is very

important that we maintain ties our

competitiveness and our security of

supply ladies and gentlemen this means

that the colonel mission would

environmentally friendly and economic by

friend s nigrum success must not be a

contradiction these two things need to

go hand-in-hand fish dish for dolphins

are also attract the audience I hole

that security after compliant is

maintained even if there are high share

of renewable energy being generated in

the finder at the beginning of the

energy transition egg into a swoon we

try to if you increase the share of

renewables and now we want to squat to

take a look at the overall system and

take a look Leo solution affordability

renewable energy transport including

even to take on more responsibility for

the overall system and lawyer but it is

to be decayed and we need to bring

enables closer to the market with light

side dish was not really at the same

time we also need to make the market on

the ultimate package for renewals so

that you can take in growing shares of

renewable energy in deutschland haven't

given to madera in Germany giving and

kind intense especially impressive don't

care about individualism can happen in

one part of the evolution

another body like that once we have in

my system now we now have a family

system in place that its market base so

feed-in tariff rates and I'll only

determined by columnist at the same time

we have made this is more flexible

epistatic we have value of improvement

the responsibility of all stakeholders

involved and we also focus on free

enterprise formations in fear anger

we've also certainly also addressed in

physics engine because the energy that

is generated is not needed not only

needed in areas where it is generated

letter so where the Sun is not shining

provide and we are not only addressing

with expansion in our own country but we

are also working together with

neighboring country and that ladies and

gentlemen in Germany they are now 1.5

G's a million electricity generation

facilities pumper of opt-in optimal a

visor midlayer sulaiman flex we played

on us and we wanted to link them up with

the demand side which is becoming more

flexible this is a real challenge

digitalization is helping a CD to this

area during students are elderly or the

visualization is the infantry are part

of our lives and it's also helping out

with providing for successful systems

integration oh yeah I in higher

education assistance we need unified

technical standard beneficiary you need

binding rules for data protection and

data security to be on time we also need

a transparent vision for the financing

of smart meters indulgence haven't vir

das Gazette strategies and Germany we

adopted the fab actually for the digital

digitalization of the energy transition

so we've provided a framework for in via

smart meters we now want to roll out the

magnitude I just in such total package

after we want to provide a comprehensive

infrastructure project from cyber

security one focus is on cybersecurity

we want to provide for security by

design because security acceptance and

we need data sovereignty be in control

of one's data requires

text messages detective anniversary and

we are also like and promotion new

approaches are going to build on

dominant-negative all we want to make

sure that the stability of the system

can be maintained even if they're high

shares available seeing headed ladies

and gentlemen digitalization also allows

for the development of new services

business models and corporation project

alpha mean exhibit and of course also in

the area of energy starters are key when

it comes to developing innovative

business models because they also help

you with established companies the

digitalization of our energy consumption

often talking about smart homes and

self-driving cars as a real room and

charlatans seen in stablish companies

early are now working everywhere around

the world they are looking for new

business model white radish Reubens bad

I'd say how he started it happily

ignorant and him are doctors are trying

to work with the established company and

sell accepted their riders lights and

off saturday so what better than

bringing together these two sides in

ministerium gurmukh smith and we found a

nice pretty energy born in the military

will forgive you set up a start-up night

for the energy sector and we will also

handle out of that sort of energy

transition of the water in a key tonight

or what the thinner the german energy

agent i will do this at an eye on him

and I'll second more than 500 companies

from around the world has participated

in ideas avoid a competition when

disguise so um yeah these be around

tonight when they're handing out it

isn't just a moment and global interest

in energy transition is steadily

increasing it's also reflected by the

increase in investment as mr. Gerber has

already said last year in investing in

renewable energy was higher than that in

Coal Fired gas-fired or nuclear power

plant and coal or guardian in some

comfort level and commercially valuable

to work higher as part of our g20

presidency we are contract

bodies like into this fight going to how

we need bananas shift investment and

flourishes in all energy sector

successfully so that we can build a

secure cooling and decarbonize energy

sector by the middle of this century

p.m. ier the international energy eigen

true on the internet Anala we want

unknowable International Energy Agency

and communities and de Rana between

imbeciles the conduct of study into how

much investment is needed for this

personal and visited by the organism for

these two focus of these organizations

it has been hurting completely new for

the first time I am in the womb bie a

has assimilated how much the energy

sector needs to reduce its emissions so

that the global rise in temperatures can

be kept well below 2 degrees and inside

until now Irina has developed a scenario

in which renew book Mein Kampf

franciscans largest share within our

energy supply in 2015 a few minutes to

change the Secretary General's will

thanks tell us about the result in a

study servant thanks it's great to be

here the emissive students to clean

indeed but what I can say is their

investments by cutting energy sector are

long so if you make the wrong decision

today you will have to foot the bill for

this initiative peekaboo new zealand HD

in the three carbonization calendar must

not be synonymous with the

industrialization via negativa the

decarbonisation of the energy sector is

a huge opportunity for modernizing our

economy conditions Alan what happened

yes we did transform us I think that we

are will act well advised the minds

learn to work together for the

transformation to work a climate

different shuffling and do it in a way

that is economically my work is outcome

of cliffs by meeting will also be set

into the ministerial need

the work of the working groups that will

take place in next government days what

each thank you via others in fact I

think that we are already in willing

otherwise we'll be here to harness the

enormous opportunities which has been

evolving in this transformation some

beer determinants right time and so let

us use to come in two days to learn from

each other now need website below and

what kind of art from the award ceremony

tonight you should also be part of the

networking event which is organized by

the federal ministry for economic

success and energy so again welcome to

Berlin I wish you wish us all a and

exciting and interesting events thank

you
