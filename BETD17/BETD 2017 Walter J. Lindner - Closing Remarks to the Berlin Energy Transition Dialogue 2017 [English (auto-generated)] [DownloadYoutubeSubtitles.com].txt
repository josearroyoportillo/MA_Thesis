Thank You Melissa ladies and gentlemen

from all over the world dignitaries

ambassadors state secretaries I don't

know whether there's still some

ministers around it's a great pleasure

to be here and to say a few final words

I know you have heard a lot of very deep

running speeches and you must be tired

so I don't want to prolong this too long

maybe a few figures this has been a

enormous conference the attendance was

more than 1,400 people we even had

problems with the fire brigades here

because that's that's the limit we can

host here we stretched a limit a little

bit but it shows it was much more than

many more than last year

more interest more attractive topic and

it shows how many people and how many

countries are interested in this topic

they have been more than 1992 against 93

countries represented here and I've

heard that translators were even

translating from Japanese and quite a

number of other languages not everyone

speaks but this shows how important this

conference is if you do have a lot of

conferences here in this very room very

stoic room talking about Syria and

talking about you know world problems

but this has been one of the biggest

will be one of the biggest this year so

I'm happy to welcome everyone for next

year's conference and we really get in

problem

in problems with the Fire Brigades here

but let's risk it I should say now

now I spent quite a lot of my time the

last ten years as ambassador in African

countries so let's see that we get some

more African countries next year

[Applause]

so that we reach a hundred participants

participating countries now when I was

ambassador in those countries one of the

trademarks of chairman of chairman

branding was our way how we said no to

nuclear energy a country who was capable

of producing and is still capable but

saying no to this for good reasons and

even a conservative government did this

it would have been a Green Party yeah I

would say yes but it was a Conservative

government in was this Chancellor now

also true is that not one size fits all

that's why there are 92 countries and

everyone has his own rights to decide

what I do to get clear a clean energy so

we are not running around and teaching

people how to do things which just

showing an example how we did it

so I think that's a good justification

to ever this kind of conference here in

this country now as I said after two

days of intense talks I think we should

end the evening on a lighter note and I

was already tempted to sit on this sofa

now maybe it's an a nice anecdote but

when I was ambassador in South Africa

just before the minister called me to

come over here to do this state

secretary job I was also one day in Cape

Town and at a conference and a on

environmental issues and a Saudis green

sofa and there were some people from the

ministry saying well why don't you sit

on the sofa we brought it here it's the

first time this sofa is abroad sit there

and we do a interview with you and I was

the first person to do an interview on

this sofa it was in Cape Town he was not

here

[Applause]

now what I didn't know is that these

software travels and travels and travels

is a frequent flyer and it has done

already 70,000 kilometers since then it

still looks very good for that I must

say but maybe what you don't know is it

also sends out tweets so it's a Twitter

it's on Twitter and it follows you and

you can follow it

so I guess must must be the only

software which you can follow and like

for that matter well what we do now is

we sent this over again on the next trip

because we start the next preparation

for the next conference next year so it

will be 2017 2018 so this sofa let's say

farewell to it and it will be again here

one year later and we tell you how many

kilometers it will have done until then

for the fourth Berlin dialogue and an

energy transition so ladies a champion

please a big hand for this sofa

well before we changed the signature

therefore 2017-2018 I want to thank you

all very much for participating in this

conference it's very enlightening to see

all of you still here after 22 days of a

conference mostly conferences tend to

you know fade out and after the first

day and but you are really enthusiasts

in this topic I liked it very much it's

a very important topic so once again

thank you very much for attending the

conference and I want to see each of you

again next year and then some people

more and maybe even from African

countries thank you very much for

attending

so ladies and gentlemen as you see the

sofa is getting a new sign and it will

soon have a new destination it will once

again Silk Road circled the globe's you

just heard as a basis for discussion of

how to achieve the global and Aggie

Venda so you can join that dialogue on

the sofa itself or if it comes to your

part of the world you can sit on it and

otherwise you can Twitter about it as

we've just heard and we hope to see

everybody next year at the Berlin energy

transition dialogue 2018
