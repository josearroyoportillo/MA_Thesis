Oh

[Music]

a good Morgan thank you very much

Melinda I'm just going to introduce a

few of the numbers that are sort of

relevant to this debate and hopefully to

then through all the conversation and so

bloomberg new energy finance we're about

200 people worldwide and we sort of

analyze all the trends that are going on

in what we call the low-carbon

transition worldwide and we got sort of

people dotted around in all parts the

world to follow exactly what's happening

happening in each region and so first of

all we can make this work yeah I can

look at the sort of latest trends in

terms of investment figures as a picture

here if you can make it out of the block

island offshore wind projects in US

which was commissioned last year one of

the first project in offshore wind in

North America so quite an exciting

development there these are the numbers

that we crunch from the bottom up on the

deals and projects that are being done

in clean energy worldwide and you can

see a trend that was very sharply up

during the previous decade and it's

bumped around the 300 billion dollar

level over the last few years 287

billion dollar big being the last figure

in 2016 as you'll see from one of my bat

to say there's kind of two ways of

looking this one is that's a hell of a

lot of money going into clean energy

that's great news you could look at it

and say well it didn't grow last year in

fact it fell a bit that's rather

disappointing so let's go on and sort of

have a look at and where we get to that

the numbers are made up and apologies

you won't be able to read the small

print here but I'll talk you through it

from the left-hand side you've got an

early stage investment in venture

capital corporate and government are in

the and private equity investments in

specialist

company and by specialist clean energy

we mean any company involved in

renewable energy excluding large hydro

and also any company involved in energy

smart technologies that includes energy

efficiency smart grid demand response

and electric vehicles and also energy

storage so things like so battery

companies are included in that so that

early stage investment if you could call

it that takes you to forty seven billion

dollars in 2016 you then get the largest

slice of investment which is renewable

energy access finance and that's the

financing of wind farm so the parks and

so on that was 187 billion dollars in

2060 there's also some digital energy

asset finance going on so smart meters

smart grid storage projects another 16

billion then there's forty billion of

small distributed capacity rooftop solar

and other small solar project that takes

us is 287 billion and then you last year

there was a record amount of acquisition

activity in clean energy 117 billion

dollars worldwide so that's people

buying projects people buying companies

so moving on what's happening by region

we should be able to sort of discern

from this that patterns of shift in

losses Melinda was saying Europe was

definitely the biggest part of the world

for investing in clean energy a few

years ago about the turn of the decade

and Asia has moved into that lead

position in recent years with with China

particularly strong but actually in 2016

what we saw was Europe holding but

pretty firm the Americas falling back a

little bit and Asia falling back quite a

lot in dollar terms and what will come

to the reasons for that so some of the

features of 2016 that we saw in clean

energy investment first of all there was

a big slowdown in dollars committed in

China particularly the second half of

the year down to with twenty six percent

year-on-year Japanese solar boom also

cooled last year

and and going the opposite direction as

big offshore wind boom happening record

figures invested in optional wind bird

worldwide in 2016 of 30 billion dollars

worldwide and then in the u.s. there was

a small full backing investment there

even though the tax credit programs have

been extended their people aren't

necessarily in a hurry to to move

because they got five years to do so now

the other big thing that's happening was

costs so remember that investment trend

appeared to be going down but actually

the costs in both wind and solar or

footballing very sharply so both wind

and solar saw average capital costs down

by well over ten percent last year I was

also true an optional wind doesn't

always been the case in recent years so

despite the falling levels of investment

there was actually rebels record amounts

of clean energy investing energy

capacity added in gigawatt terms so in

the case of soda at 75 gigawatts against

56 gigawatts beer before so we've never

had so much wind and solar installed

work worldwide now looking at Europe

they're just very briefly I mentioned

the European trend had sort of flattened

out in recent years after coming down

from the peak at the turn of the decade

and what this chart shows is a sectoral

mix so in the sub 2010-2011 period it

was very much dominated by small-scale

solar particularly in Germany in Italy

that's fallen back very very sharply in

recent years onshore wind has kind of

been fairly steady but but a growth area

really in Europe being offshore wind

where we see some really huge financings

in the last two years with with last

year being a record at around twenty six

billion dollars so moving quickly on the

policy picture here of what the Swansea

Bay tidal lagoon project in the UK is

you look like if the government gives

you the go-ahead in the next few weeks

it'll be an interesting decision

whichever the way they go on that one of

the big thing that's been happening on

policy is to move to auctions so instead

of having feed-in tariffs and green

certificates countries and the world are

increasingly moving to auctions as a way

to allocate renewable energy capacity

and that's resulting in some

staggeringly low prices for projects

that are going ahead so I've noted some

three records here solar the lowest one

that we've seen $29 10 per megawatt hour

in Chile onshore wind $30 a

megawatt-hour in Morocco offshore winds

55 dollars per megawatt errands in

Denmark so much much lower figure than

anybody would have dreamed of a few

years ago all these places have got

their own particular characteristics and

you can't say well that's the sort of

the milestone for everywhere else in the

world at the moment that's certainly not

the case there is a ravaged figure which

is different but it's a real sort of

symbol of what's happening in terms of

cost and auctions are spreading around

the world this is a map showing a hammer

for every country in which some kind of

auction mechanism is being introduced or

has been introduced to allocate

renewable energy capacity and you can

see it's pretty widespread now started

off inflated likely Brazil about five or

six years ago but it's really spreading

and Europe is picked up the auction that

fashion as well I wanted quickly to look

at what's happening with levelized cost

of electricity per megawatt hour which

is not just about the cost per megawatt

but also how much it costs of unit of

electricity that you generate three

lines here one is so low which is been

down massively since 2009 so about a

seventy percent reduction in levelized

cost of electricity the line at the

bottom is onshore wind so although it

looks fairly flat that's only in relay

into the comparison with solar it's

actually fallen by twenty percent or so

over over those over those years which

is very significant and then the line

that sort of goes up and then down

that's offshore wind so for a while

projects got more expensive but recently

there's been a big focus on cost and

cost of incoming down rapidly in dollar

terms what about electricity a picture

of a led here because that the

revolution and lighting has been some

massive influence on electricity demand

worldwide and what these two lines show

is the top line is GDP growth although

it doesn't feel like we've had great

great economic growth in the OECD

countries in the last few years there

has been growth and but what we've seen

is electricity demand has not really

grown at all so the two lines are

completely separated from each other we

haven't seen that happen before and it's

massively massively significant in terms

of electricity demand position of the

utilities and also the outlook for

emissions so what about renewables as a

share of electricity consumption like I

can't couldn't choose every country was

relevant to the panel unfortunately by

chosen three countries Germany the US

and the UK and you can see in each case

renewables arriving as a proportion of

electricity produced in Germany you

would lose to here is out in front they

were the figure of over thirty percent

UK is risen very sharply over recent

years as a result the policies that it

had in the first part of this decade and

the US despite the gas revolution there

there's also been a rising share for

renewables what does it mean in terms of

emissions well again I've chosen these

three countries if you look at the world

worldwide picture on emissions it's not

quite so encouraging it's being kind of

flashes the last couple of years but

most projections are for worldwide

emissions to increase over the next

decade as more country sort of build up

their electricity generation but what

we're seeing in the missions in Germany

the US and the UK

a slightly different pictures Germany

made some good progress in the sort of

early years the trend seems to flattened

out recently some of the reasons to do

with what the minister said on on

lignite for instance the u.s. emissions

went up for considerable periods but

have fallen back more recently as as

gases push coal out the system and in UK

the figures are quite remarkable really

coal is being pushed down about four

percent of electricity generation than

those recent figures and UK emissions

are down to about fifty percent of what

they were in 1990 not all due to do with

choices of generation but very

significant number less so I'm now going

to hand back to Melinda thank you
