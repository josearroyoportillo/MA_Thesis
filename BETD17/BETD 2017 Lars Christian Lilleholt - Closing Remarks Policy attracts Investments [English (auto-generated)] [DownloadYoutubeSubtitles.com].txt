thank you very much for the invitation

to be today and thank you for an

interesting discussion during the

workshop it's a great honor to be able

to present the Danish perspective at the

Berlin energy sensation dialogue last

month the World Bank published a big

report on green energy it concluded that

Denmark has the best framework

conditions in the world when it comes to

green energy a few months earlier the

world Energy Council council published

its annual report it also found Denmark

to be number one in the world in

providing stable cheap and green energy

these results made everyone in taneous

energy sector very proud Denmark has now

has shown the way to bring growth since

1990 Denmark GDP has concluded while the

use of energy has reminded constant and

co2 image emissions have fallen I think

for Maine we say relation for this

development first since the 1970s

Dainius energy policy has been based on

broad political agreement between most

parties in Parliament this means policy

stability and that it is key to

investors who think long term

the government's goal is to make Denmark

independent of fossil fuel by 2050 and

to cover at least half of the total

energy needs with green energy by 2030

this will help create stable and

long-terms police police's second

finance financial supports for specific

technologies had advanced technology

development and cut the cost of energy

in the future however we must look to

more market-based solutions this way we

can spend our money in the most

effective way first

good conditions for research have been

important company have been able to test

new technologies for example new wind

turbines the government is right now

moving and expanding natural set-asides

for both onshore and offshore wind

servants at the end of last year we had

at center for a new Danis offshore wind

farm of 600 megawatt called Korea's flag

this Center was won by Vattenfall for a

price of only five years since per

kilowatt-hour a new world record that

confirms Denmark's position as a leader

in wind energy our long-term goals is to

make Denmark the first country in the

world that can deploy new offshore wind

capacity on market terms alone without

any violent financial support moreover

Denmark is a part of mission innovation

and we are committed to double public

investment in clean energy research and

development over five years for the

Nordic Council has a well function and

integrated electricity market this mean

that the world sale price of electricity

in Denmark is the same as in at at least

our neighbor or country 90% of the time

when the wind blows in Denmark this out

we sell power so Norway Sweden and your

who to power planes in Norway can fill

their times and when the wind doesn't

blow in Denmark Norway can we we export

people power to Denmark this help

integrate wind energy into the market

the government works for European

ethnicity and market that is integrated

market-based and flexibility energy

should flow freely with in member that

states as well as across national

borders alternative energy must be

integrated into the system and Europeans

had to be sure to have power when they

turn on the lights

natural frameworks cannot stand alone

all you members states should look at

their energy policies from an European

perspective and we must work together to

create a good European framework for a

green investments these were some of the

framework conditions that have helped

Denmark make a leader in green energy my

ambition is to maintain this position

therefore we must work together on an

European and global level discussion

what works and learning from one another

is an important step in this direction I

would like very much like to thank you

for the invitation to speak here today

and I wish you a good conference
