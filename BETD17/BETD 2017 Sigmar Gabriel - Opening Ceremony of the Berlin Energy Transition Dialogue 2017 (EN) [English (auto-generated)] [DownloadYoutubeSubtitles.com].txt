Hiba for colleague in

Minister Zhu please ladies and gentlemen

mr. negaal mr. Armey mr. picker

distinguished guests welcome to the

Federal Foreign Office and welcome to

the third Berlin energy transition

dialog it's somewhat of a tradition now

we are able to welcome people from more

than 90 countries actually this is

probably a record number of participants

we've never had so many high ranking

ministers and delegations we feel very

honored by this and you can feel it not

only here in this room but also whenever

I travel to other countries in the world

and when we discuss the energy supply we

can feel that a lot is changing we are

seeing a an international transition and

investment in in renewable energies is

now higher than investment in

conventional energies and that's a bit

of a first and something that we find

very interesting is that it is not

mostly industrialized countries that are

expanding the share of renewable energy

the most in fact it is developing

countries and emerging economies the

ones that I at the beginning of

industrialization so something that was

a bit of an old idea in the developed

world an idea that some laughed about or

used to laugh about is now a trend for

the future and this means not only that

we are able to generate energy in a more

environmentally way we can also do it in

a decentralized in a distributed way and

we can do it in a way that creates a

great deal of jobs in

alone we have created 300,000 jobs in

this new industry that is the renewable

energy industry so you can see that

environmentally-friendly nests the

protection of our climate and economic

success go very well together this is

the development that is having a very

positive impact not only on our energy

supply but also on our economy as a

whole today I'm not only your Minister

of Economy or energy but today I'm here

as Germany's foreign minister because

energy policy is part of our foreign

policy now it is also because it's a

question of our national security and of

equity and fairness equality and

fairness it is something that has to do

a lot with stability and peace in our

world and the reasons for this are

obvious we can see that countries that

are highly dependent too dependent on

commodity imports can be put under

pressure not only economically but also

whenever there's a disruption in the

supply chain because of civil war or any

sort of crisis we can also see that

commodities themselves can be the object

of Civil War and of conflict and we can

see that climate change can exasperate

the situation incident in areas that are

already affected by crises access to

food is becoming more of an problem in

those areas where there's little access

to energy and this means that there is

greater fight for those areas of a

particular country where there still an

energy supply and a food supply energy

supply in developing countries is very

much requisition prerequisite for these

countries to actually catch up

economically and this is why we need an

international energy transition not

only because of the environment because

of our climate and because of all that

we need it because it will help make the

world's a better and fairer place and

this is something that the the

international community has recognized

it has made it its goal to create a

global and sustainable energy supply

this is part of the 2030 UN agenda and

of course we agreed on the cop agreement

at Paris in Paris at the Paris

conference now it's the time to actually

implement these decisions we stand by

our commitments and we want to use our

g20 presidency in Germany to actually

make headway on this our goal is to

reach a unanimous position on the part

of all g20 countries so that we can help

decarbonize the energy sector and this

means that we need to bring down

subsidies for fossil fuels and we need

to invest in renewables of course fossil

fuels will continue to be important in

the future because they will serve as

commodities that can be used in much of

our industry of our industrial sectors

ladies and gentlemen the International

Energy transition is in full swing we

are at the cusp of a new era and for me

as a foreign policy expert and also from

an economic point of view we need I know

that we need agreement in order to be

able to actually implement the the

decisions made in New York and in Paris

and this also means that we need to have

good institutions such as Irina and the

International Energy Agency we have

Fatih Birol and admin Annan here they're

the heads of these institutions welcome

to you of course

policy makers can't shoulder this task

on their own we need to have a very

strong dialogue between governments

investors the energy industry and civil

society representatives and this is what

we've come to do here today we want to

shape the energy transition at a global

level and we want to have a reliable and

affordable energy

supply for the entire world so that we

can reconcile and promote environmental

goals and economic goals and equality

thank you very much for your work and

for coming here and all the best and

every success for this conference thank

you
