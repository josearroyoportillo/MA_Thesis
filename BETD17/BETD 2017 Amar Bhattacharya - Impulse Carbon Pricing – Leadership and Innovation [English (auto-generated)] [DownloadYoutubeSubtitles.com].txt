thank you so much for that so I'm going

to come to carbon pricing from another

side which is what's the ultimate

objective that we are pushing for at

this point in time and within that what

role does carbon pricing play and I'm

going to build that very much around the

work on sustainable infrastructure the

work of the new climate economy which

I've been privileged to be associated

with and the starting point i would say

is that we now have a new global agenda

which as we heard from mr. Bach is

actually about growth it's in fact about

reigniting growth it's about the 2030

development agenda and it is about

delivering on the ambitions of the Paris

agreement and at the heart of that

really is sustainable infrastructure

delivering on sustainable infrastructure

is the path to get us there and it is

the growth story of the future it

provides the impetus right now to the

global economy that means that that is

needed in a balanced way it provides the

innovation in a shin Batarian sense for

productivity and medium-term growth and

it's the only growth story on offer that

is out there for the long term and we

saw that I think in the slide before and

it's a good story that delivers not just

on climate it delivers on sustained

growth it delivers on cities where we

can live and move and breathe it

delivers on ecosystems that are

resilient and it delivers on the quality

of life or for all including the poor

and if you look at it in the context of

the sustainable development goals which

are a unifying framework that have been

adopted by world leaders you will see

that sustainable infrastructure actually

relates to all of those goals in terms

of inclusive

growth in terms of empowering and

delivery of basic services and in terms

of environmental sustainability and I

think the central point to be recognized

is that of urgency and scale the next 10

to 20 years are really a moment in

history why because the amount of

infrastructure that we are going to put

in place in the next 10 to 20 years is

about or more than what we have on the

planet today so it is a great

opportunity for us to make a great leap

forward it's also an opportunity for us

to put ourselves in water literally so

getting it right is going to be very

important and I think what is

particularly important to recognize is

that Paris at one hand set very high

level of ambition but on the other hand

it recognized that without ramping up

ambitions we are not going to deliver on

the ambitions of Paris and my colleague

of my Eden Hoffer made that evidently

clear in the previous presentation now

together with this urgency comes

opportunities and there are several

opportunities particularly that are

important the first is that we are

living in a period where financially we

enjoy relatively good conditions

especially relatively low interest rates

to finance long-term infrastructure we

also enjoy great technological advances

as we have heard through the course of

the day and we have the opportunity to

shape an infrastructure that doesn't

exist even today most of this

infrastructure will be in emerging

markets and developing countries and

these countries have great opportunities

to leapfrog and avoid the mistakes of

the past

this is a graph that autumn our had

talked about so I will skip it but I

want to talk about the composition of

infrastructure spending and this came

true even in the mornings presentation

when you look at the total amount of

infrastructure that needs to be invested

in it's not that different in total

amounts but there are two things that

are extremely important in terms of

composition first we need to invest a

lot more on energy efficiency and second

we need to make a major shift from

conventional infrastructure to

low-carbon infrastructure and that means

by the way not just renewables but

changing the trajectory of all

infrastructure second point I think very

important to point out is there's

tremendous disparity in the levels of

energy consumption at one and you can

see that in terms of the magnitudes of

consumption across countries and regions

and as was pointed out again this

morning and pointed out by autumn are

the consumption levels indeed the access

to energy is a major discrepancy in the

system also as was pointed out

technology is a great advantage to us

today not only in terms of right and

falling costs in terms of the generation

but also in the possibilities of storage

and together falling costs for energy

production and greater opportunities for

energy storage is a transformative

moment together despite these

opportunities though I think it is fair

to say that we are falling short in two

respects first too much of the

infrastructure that exists today is

aging inefficient and polluting and we

are not replacing it as fast as we

should and that's mainly a challenge in

advanced economies but

it's also a challenge in many emerging

markets notably China and India second

too much of the infrastructure the new

infrastructure that is being built is

still old infrastructure in the sense it

is based on suboptimal technologies that

will last for a long long time so we

need to change the game and when you

think about changing the game there are

four reinforcing elements that come

together in changing the game the first

and very centrally is carbon pricing at

the moment we are in a territory of

negative prices because of subsidies so

we have to move from negative prices

even before we talk about a price for

carbon so elimination of fossil fuel

subsidies and then getting to a positive

price for carbon is the first element of

the platform the second one is that

despite the fact that price of carbon is

very important a lot indeed a majority

of investment decisions are till still

determined by public policy so public

policy can have a very important element

in changing direction through investment

climbing and government procurement and

indeed setting the direction third

finance can be a very powerful way of

driving an enabling change and finally

we need to do a better job in terms of

consultant support of Technology so it's

important to see carbon pricing as one

element of a combined package of

policies second and speaking for

emerging markets and developing

countries it's important to recognize

that we cannot have a uniform approach

to carbon pricing but we can't have an

extremely discordant approach otherwise

there won't be a level playing field so

what are the arguments would

annunciation one argument is very

clearly that emission reduction targets

may not be as stringent in low-income

countries or lower-income countries as

they should be in advanced countries

second for a given price you might have

more emission reduction in an emerging

market than you might in an advanced

country because of the in some sense the

elasticity of demand may be quite

different third as was pointed out the

distributional impacts of carbon pricing

have to be taken into account in theory

you can compensate be efficient I mean

by having transfers but in practice that

may be very difficult however there are

two other arguments on the other side

that suggest that carbon pricing may

actually be relatively favorable in poor

countries the first is that there are

very important core benefits especially

in terms of pollution which has a

tremendously deleterious effect on the

poor and the second is as we heard

carbon prices generate revenues that can

be used for health education things like

sustainable infrastructure all in all we

know that carbon pricing has to be

somewhat differentiated but at the same

time we need to have some clarity going

forward so that we don't create in some

sense a playing field that is damaging

for business and and for countries I

want to spend one minute on another

aspect of complementary policy that has

just come into force and that is climate

related financial disclosure why is it

closely related because it is also a

powerful incentive if you have full

disclosure of risks and exposure both in

terms of physical risks and as well as

in terms of policy it will not only

provide stability to the financial

system but it will be a very important

in

for businesses to change practices and

to move to a low-carbon transition the

FSB task force on climate related

financial disclosure has come out with

its recommendations the g20 considered

them at finance ministers level in

baden-baden just past weekend and moving

forward with those recommendations

getting them traction will be a very

important part of the Arsenal the global

Commission on the economy and the

climate in my view has correctly pressed

that we should not just leave it at a

voluntary level but we should push for

mandatory use ultimately off of this

disclosure again to create a level

playing field I don't want to turn and

close with the issue of Finance so

there's plenty of savings in the world

right now but their problem is that we

are not able to turn in some sense

investment opportunities into real

demand and we are not able to mobilize

the financing that we need to meet those

financing demands i also want to stress

that the cost of capital is something

that we often ignore if you look at the

cost of capital and the difference in

cost of capital between advanced

countries and emerging markets it often

tilt the balance against more

sustainable investments in this graph

you will see that if you compare for

example you know gas to win in an

advanced economy it's about the same but

with the costs of financing it becomes

much less attractive to go for the

renewable option in emerging markets in

developing countries to close let me

just make one point we talk about

climate finance we talk about mobilizing

private finance ultimately the scale of

investment we are looking at is in the

trillions as we have heard and the

challenge is how do we move from the

billions to the

trillions and one very powerful

instrument in that which we haven't

talked about today is the role of

multilateral Development Bank's they

play a key role in the upfront reforms

that are needed to make projects viable

and sustainable they play a key role in

de-risking and they play a key role in

bringing together the parties that

ultimately constitute what we would call

viable sustainable projects at the

moment multilateral Development Bank's

in aggregate land about 70 billion in

total about 50 billion for sustainable

infrastructure then total needs for

sustainable infrastructure and emerging

markets and developing countries will be

are in the order of about two trillion

right now rising two three to four

trillion in the period I'm talking about

so to catalyze the kind of private

financing that we need we need to put

the multilateral Development Bank's and

a very very different footing than they

are today and that has to be also part

of the equation so coming back carbon

pricing is a central foundation if it is

wrong we can't build the other pillars

but it's not the only foundation to get

to the objectives that we are and it's

extremely important than we have this

debate and discussion to look at this as

part of a package that is adapted and

that moves us to a scale and at a pace

that is much faster than we are have

that we are and we have been at thank

you thank you very much

you
