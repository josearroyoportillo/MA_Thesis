ladies and gentlemen's excellences thank

you very much for inviting us to present

our thoughts on carbon pricing we means

the Federation of the German industry

BDI

and German watch and the Research

Institute MCC our gathering forces and

together we wanted to show a very simple

thing first that there is no trade off

no fundamental conflict between climate

policy economic growth and

competitiveness and this three goals can

be reconciled when carbon pricing is

designed in a reasonable and in a smart

way now what I would like to do is for

the next few minutes to convince you

that carbon pricing is important and at

first glance this sounds a little bit

odd because many people are talking

about the declining costs for PV

photovoltaic and wind and also about a

lot of technological breakthroughs in

the era of renewables and as you know in

the next few decades we need a peak in

emissions rapid decline of the emissions

and basically by and large at the first

half of the century we need to achieve

zero emissions if we want to achieve the

climate goals so what's the role of

carbon pricing in this perspective and

in order to explain the role of carbon

pricing let me elaborate a little bit on

this figure the first of all the Paris

agreement

has highlighted a very simple but

nevertheless a very important fact that

the atmosphere is a limiting disposal

space limiting the increase of the mean

temperature well below 2 degree we are

allowed to release 800 gigatons

co2 so if we do a little bit more let's

say 1,000 or 2,000 gigatons so then we

will see a sharp increase of global mean

temperature which is not consistent with

the Paris agreement now if we look about

the resource and reserved of the fossil

fuels we see that we have basically

15,000 he got on co2 underground as coal

and gas and oil admittedly we will not

extract all these resources underground

because there are increasing extraction

costs but nevertheless even if we just

rely on the economic viable parts of

this 15,000 roughly 80% of coal and 2/3

of oil and gas over the century has to

remain underground the crucial question

is what kind of economic incentives can

be created what kind of policy

instruments should be implemented in

order to achieve this goal

there is a huge discussion what kind of

instruments but it is obvious that

carbon pricing is an effective and I

would like to elaborate on this it's

also a just way to deal with this

transformation pathway a carbon price

basically has three wonderful

characteristics first a carbon price

incentivizes carbon free technologies

second a carbon price saves fossil fuels

that you

of fossil fuels in third it creates

revenues so without a carbon price let's

assume that there is a breakthrough in

the renewable technologies so then

people will use more of these

technologies but at the same time this

will also lower the fossil fuel prices

and in the end we might perceive and

might observe an increasing share of

renewables but at the same time also an

increasing share using fossil fuels the

only way how to overcome this problem is

to impose a carbon price because the

carbon price helps us on the one hand to

force the new technologies to

incentivize innovation but at the same

time to help us to save fossil fuels and

as I said it creates revenues and this

revenues could be used either to reduce

other Texas or what's quite important in

the context of the g20 to finance public

infrastructure around the globe there is

a significant under investment in public

infrastructure in particular in the

water sector in the provision of clean

electricity transport and

telecommunication at first glance it

seems that we cannot reconcile the

overuse of the atmosphere and the under

provision of infrastructure investments

but in fact with carbon pricing we can

overcome this trade-off so if we look in

the infrastructure investments which are

needed in the g20 we see this is a

number around 80 trillion US dollar in

the sectors of taluk telecommunication

water and sanitation transport and

energy and the majority of this

investments have to go to the upper

middle-income countries and therefore a

carbon pricing scheme has to comprise

two important components the first one

what is needed is the phase-out of

fossil fuel subsidies

and secondly we need an increasing

carbon price because only an increasing

carbon price incentivizes the new

technologies we need it now you might

think this carbon pricing idea is just

something which academics would like to

propose but in fact this is not the case

since 2005 we have seen many emerging

carbon pricing schemes consisting of

carbon taxes or emissions trading

schemes and by 2025 we will see around

the globe many new emerging systems and

this is quite interesting because in

this countries where carbon pricing is

implemented revenues are available and

what you can see here is that carbon

pricing even moderate carbon pricing

allows us to finance the infrastructure

needs in many countries here basically

you can see only in countries where you

have the purple the purple color the

infrastructure costs are larger than the

public revenues raised by carbon pricing

and in most of the countries carbon

pricing is sufficient to finance

infrastructure needs so in the end

carbon pricing has a huge potential to

incentivize low-carbon transition and at

the same time the infrastructure and

therefore we propose that the g20 should

adopt a roadmap to gradually introduce

carbon pricing including a phase-out of

fossil fuel subsidies in consistence and

in accordance with the g20 presidency

introduced introduction of a carbon

pricing mechanism differentiate by

countries and comprising has basically

in this context two main effects

steering the investments into the right

direction and generating revenues that

can be used to finance low carbon and

climate resilient infrastructure so in

the end what we are saying in

claiming is make comprising work things

thank you for the invitation climate and

establish lament is peace and

development climate is business the last

sentence was key sentence the tram and

Chancellor Merkel and Donald Trump

discussed a few days ago during lunch

carbon pricing is not the Silver Bullet

we need clearly a mix of instruments but

if we want to reach the targets from

Paris the temperature the limits the

temperature limits of Therese it's also

quite clear that without a double carbon

price signal it will be very difficult

to reach this double carbon price

nickmoore means to phase out fossil fuel

subsidies in the next couple of years

and to get positive carbon price signal

which could be emission trading which

could be Texas which could be levies in

different g20 countries and it's a new

quality for the debate that businesses

think tanks and civil society join

forces to ask for this together both on

a national level but also between p20 T

20 and C 20 with this support now the

ball is in the field of decision makers

let's go ahead thank you

yeah thank you for having us here with

our small initiative the carbon pricing

definitely will not happen as a

one-size-fits-all solution it's going to

come in many ways so every nation has to

find its own nationally suitable way to

do it but to coordinate these approaches

is of the most the biggest importance we

see and I think that cooperative and

especially comparable and really

comparable approaches will the best way

to do it our initiative wants to

encourage the countries and especially

the countries of the g20 as they are the

ones with almost 80 percent of all

emissions in the world and with more

than 85 percent of the global GDP to

resort on this way to develop their own

ways to price carbon and to make them

comparable because from a business

perspective I am quite sure that if we

would resort in a way like this we would

see a huge technological and economic

dynamic in the world beginning in the

g20 and then jumping over to the other

countries and this would be helpful for

all for business for climate for

governments for industry carnations and

for developing countries and therefore I

truly believe that this effort is

important and that it is good that we

are asked our government to put this on

the agenda of the g20 thank you
