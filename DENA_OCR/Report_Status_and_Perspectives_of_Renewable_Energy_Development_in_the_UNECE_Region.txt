Project Overview:
UNECE Renewable Energy Uptake

The member states of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) differ not only in 
their language, culture and geography, but also
in their energy systems. While some countries have already achieved very high shares of renewable 
energy in the electricity and heating market, others
are only at the beginning of this transition. There is therefore great potential in cross-border 
knowledge transfer.

As part of the project “UNECE Renewable Energy Uptake”, the UNECE, the Deutsche Energie-Agentur 
(dena) - the German Energy Agency - and the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century 
(REN21) facilitate this transfer of knowledge and best practices through various activities. In 
addition to the presented report “Status and Perspectives of Renewable Energy Development in the 
UNECE Region”, prepared by dena, REN21 delivers its UNECE Renewable Energy Status Report under the 
project as well.2

In addition to the dena and REN21 reports, a series of four Renewable Energy ‘Hard Talks’ with 
selected UNECE member states were held as part of the project. The ‘Hard Talk’ is a discussion 
format on current topics of renewable energy held with relevant stakeholders of the participating 
UNECE member nations and international energy community and organized by the UNECE Secretariat and 
partner organizations. Over the duration of the project in 2021 and 2022, Hard Talks were held with 
Albania, Georgia, Serbia, and the Republic of Moldova.

Key Insights
The UNECE’s member states are highly diverse with regards to conditions, legal frameworks and 
motivations for the uptake of renewable energy. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 
(UNECE) region comprises 56 countries throughout Europe, North America and Asia.
Their energy systems are characterised by differences in resource availability, market design, 
regulation and policy as well as existing infrastructure. The main motivations driving the uptake 
of renewable energy are mitigation of climate change as well as regional pollution, the 
reconstruction of future-proof economies after the Covid-19 pandemic, improvements of security of 
affordable energy supply and energy independence.

Between 2018 and 2021 wind and PV markets have expanded dynamically among member states with higher 
relative growth than other renewable energy sources. The median PV market growth rate in the UNECE 
region between 2018 and 2021 reached 22.2%. In 2021, PV power plants contributed 9.8% to the total 
electricity generation capacity. Poland, Estonia, Ukraine, Hungary, Spain, Cyprus and the 
Netherlands show high growth rates with significant market penetration. For wind the median annual 
market growth rate was significantly lower than that of PV (7.1%) reaching a median capacity share 
of 11.3%. Belgium, Greece, Sweden, the Netherlands, Croatia, France, Lithuania, Norway as well as 
Finland show above-median growth rates in combination with above-median market shares.

Almost all UNECE member states proactively introduced policies aiming to overcome existing 
challenges that limit further expansion of renewable energy. Despite the recent growth especially 
in wind and solar capacities, a lack of long-term energy strategies, economic viability, 
infrastructural flexibility, as well as awareness and acceptance frequently hamper the successful 
deployment of renewable energy throughout the region. As a consequence, UNECE member
states applied a variety of different policies throughout the region such as legally binding 
expansion goals, guaranteed priority dispatch for renewable power generators and feed-in-tariffs or 
– premiums.

Given the differences in renewable energy deployment status and approaches to policy- making, there 
is a large potential for knowledge transfer and mutual learning among UNECE member states. In 2021 
and 2022 a series of four Hard Talks were held in the framework of the UNECE Re-Uptake project with 
selected member states (Albania, Georgia, Serbia and Republic
of Moldova) facilitating this knowledge transfer. The dialogues led to concrete recommendations 
regarding network integration, renewable policy support and bankability of renewable projects in 
Albania; building support for investments in renewable energy in Georgia; net-metering and 
renewable energy auctions in Serbia; and successful expansion and integration of renewables, 
including resilience and flexibility options in the Republic of Moldova. The findings of the Hard 
Talks are summarised in this report.

01  Introduction




1.1  Regional Overview

The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) region comprises 56 countries throughout 
Europe, North Amer- ica and Asia with a total population of 1.3 billion (figure 1). It ac- counts 
for 42% of global GDP3 and 35% of global carbon emis- sions from fossil fuel use4. The region is 
geographically, economi- cally and culturally highly diverse. This also holds true for the en- ergy 
systems of member states, which are characterised by vast differences in resource availability and 
potential, market design, regulation and policy, and infrastructure.

5 Introduction

1.2  Scope of the Report

This report provides an overview of renewable energy deploy- ment and policymaking in the region. 
It points out recent trends and developments in both the deployment of different renew- able energy 
technologies and supporting policies in the UNECE member states. By doing so, it establishes a 
basis for discussion among UNECE member countries and informs policy making in the transition to a 
more sustainable energy supply. In turn, this will help achieve national and global energy and 
climate targets and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Renewable energy sources include hydropower, wind, solar photovoltaic (PV), solar thermal, 
geothermal, ocean energy (tidal/wave), renewable municipal waste, solid biofuels, liquid biofuels 
and biogases.5 Renewable energy can be utilised for various applications including electricity 
generation, heating and cooling, and mobility. Renewable electricity plays a central role as it 
provides the basis for the utilisation and dissemination of renewable energy across all energy 
consumption sectors through sector coupling. The direct use of electricity is also the most 
efficient means by which the majority of modern energy needs can be met.

The presented analysis therefore has a particular focus on the status of electricity generation 
from renewable energy sources in the region. Within this context, the report takes an in-depth look 
at PV and wind energy, as they have been the most rapidly expanding technologies in recent years 
and constitute the most significant renewable energy sources with the greatest resource
potential across the region. This has created particularly dynamic market and policy development.

In addition, the report provides information on the status of renewable heat generation throughout 
the region. Heating remains the single largest energy application, accounting for nearly half of 
global final energy consumption.6 This includes process heat for industrial manufacturing, spatial 
heating in residential and commercial buildings as well as water heating for cooking and hygiene. 
Despite this significance, public discussion around the use of renewables still mainly focuses on 
the power sector. Taking this into account, the presented report also reflects on initiatives for 
renewable heating, with the aim of creating awareness for the importance of sustainable heating in 
the energy transition as a whole.
1.3  Structure of the Report

This report is divided into six chapters. Following this introduc- tion, the second chapter 
provides a status quo of renewable energy deployment in the UNECE region. The third chapter 
presents an overview of barriers and challenges that hinder renewable energy development in the 
UNECE region and provides a set of guiding questions that can help policymakers approach the 
identified challenges. Chapter four analyses which renewable energy policies are applied throughout 
the region, looking at both renewable electricity and heat. The fifth chapter then provides a more 
detailed look at concrete challenges to and recommendations for the uptake of renewable energy in 
four selected UNECE member states. These were established through four country-specific stakeholder 
dialogues (Renewable Energy “Hard Talks”) under the Renewable Uptake Project. The sixth and final 
chapter conculdes the report.

6 Introduction







Status Quo of Renewable Energy Deployment
in the UNECE Region






2.1  Motivations for the Uptake of Renewable Energy

As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report highlighted once 
again, the world is set on a global warming trajectory leading to potentially devastating ef- fects 
for nature and human life due to the excessive emission
of carbon into the atmosphere.7 Acknowledging this, more and more countries, regions, and 
institutions in the UNECE region came forward with pledges to reach carbon neutrality or at least 
substantially reduce their carbon emissions in the years leading up to 2050. One of the most 
significant sources of carbon emis- sions causing global warming is the combustion of fossil fuels 
for energy generation. Consequently, the deployment and rapid ex- pansion of low-carbon, renewable 
energy is one of the central le- vers in order to mitigate climate change. As a result, interest in 
renewable energy sources is stronger than ever – not only in the UNECE region, but also globally. 
In addition to climate change mitigation, renewable energy also holds other environmental benefits 
such as the reduction of air pollution, which has been a particularly important driver in East 
Asia.

Within the last decade, economies of scale and advances in tech- nology have driven down the costs 
of various renewable energy technologies, substantially improving their economics. Levelised cost 
of electricity (LCOE; €/kWh) for solar and wind power tech- nologies have declined rapidly, with 
solar PV seeing the steep- est reduction of LCOE with 82%. Today, “more than half of the renewable 
capacity added […] achieves lower power costs than the cheapest new coal plants”.8 In fact, “for 
projects with low- cost financing that tap high-quality resources, solar PV is now the cheapest 
source of electricity in history”.9 Aligning environmen- tal benefits with economic realities, this 
development is another major driver for the deployment of wind and PV assets for elec- tricity 
generation.

In the aftermath of the COVID19-pandemic, economic recovery has also been high on the agenda of 
political decision-makers. In

7  IPCC 2022
8  IRENA 2020, 6/2
9  IEA 2020

an effort to connect recovery programs with necessary infrastruc- ture investments and to promote 
economic activity, renewable energy projects have gained even more interest. Frequently, this is 
coupled with intentions to enable long-term economic growth through the establishment of new, 
future-proof industries and value chains.

In addition to environmental and economic arguments, the role of renewable energy in improving 
security of energy supply and energy independence has become more important. As generat- ing energy 
from renewable sources is local and largely independ- ent from global fuel markets, it reduces 
dependencies on energy imports and increases a country’s energy security. By diversifying the 
national energy mix, it further increases energy security and resilience.

While several of the above benefits and drivers play a more sig- nificant role than others in 
different UNECE member states, both from a resource availability and political standpoint, it is a 
com- bination that ultimately leads countries to pursue and deploy re- newable energy. The 
following subchapters will explore to which extent these efforts have been successful in the UNECE 
region.


2.2  Renewable Energy Deployment Trends

In the past decade, the expansion of renewable energy in the UNECE region has progressed rapidly. 
In 2021, the installed elec- tricity generation capacity of renewable energy sources amount- ed to 
1,211 GW, 460 GW of which were hydropower assets (ex- cluding pumped storage hydro). This share of 
the UNECE region represents about 39% of the 3,074 GW of renewable generation capacity installed 
worldwide. Renewable energy has developed faster and more dynamically than any other source of 
energy in recent years. Between 2018 and 2021, 214 GW of renewable gen- eration capacity was added 
in the region. In the same period the installed fossil capacity declined by 60 GW. However, the 
accumu- lated renewable energy generation capacity of 1,211 GW remains smaller than total fossil 
generation capacity of 1,500 GW.10

7 Status quo of renewable energy deployment in the UNECE region

Deployment of renewable energy relative to total energy consumption
In conjunction with and as a result of the expansion of renewables, the share of renewable energy 
in total final energy consumption (TFEC) has also increased throughout the UNECE region (see Figure 
2). Looking at the sub-region-level, Southeast Europe showed the fastest growth while the Russian 
Federation had the least growth, where the share of renewable energy in TFEC fell by 0.6% when 
comparing 2019 to 1990. From 2004 onwards, Western and Central Europe substantially increased their 
share of renewable energy
in TFEC to 19.2% in 2019, showing the steadiest growth of all regions in the past decade. Renewable 
energy use also grew steadily, but slower, in North America and Eastern Europe reaching 11.7% and 
7.5% of TFEC, respectively. Both Central Asia and the Caucasus showed growing renewable shares in 
TFEC before a decline from 2004 to 2006 followed by stagnating growth to date.

Figure 2: Development of renewable energy in TFEC in UNECE regions from 1990 to 201911


Figures 3 to 6 illustrate in greater detail the share of different renewable energy sources in the 
TFEC of the UNECE regions. Figure 3 suggests that the prevalent use of bioenergy12 is behind the 
remarkably high share of renewable energy in Southeast Europe indicated in Figure 2. Although 
slowly declining since 2008, the majority of bioenergy used in Southeast Europe stems from solid 
biofuels (indicated by the additional semi-transparent line in figure 3 showing the share of solid 
biofuels in TFEC).

Solid biofuels are associated with the combustion of organic and raw material, such as wood. In 
Southeast Europe, it is primarily used for heating applications in the residential sector, which
accounted for 80% of total bioenergy use. Solid biofuels however, are a major source of local air 
pollution, especially when used with inefficient indoor stoves. In addition, the unsustainable use 
of solid biofuels through illegal deforestation or a lack of sus- tainable forest management 
processes and regulation can drive deforestation and loss of natural habitat, leading to further 
en- vironmental issues. Such issues lend to scrutiny as to whether traditional, solid biofuels can 
be considered a truly sustainable source of renewable energy.13 Modern bioenergy solutions (e.g. 
wood pellets, bio-diesel, energy crop cultivation), on the other hand, address such problems, 
particularly in connection with legislation enforcing sustainable agriculture and forestry 
practices.14

11 Illustration based on IEA, IRENA, UNSD, World Bank, WHO (2022). Countries are weighted within 
their region according to their total energy consumption (in TJ).
12 IRENA defines bioenergy as “energy derived from organic, non-fossil material of biological 
origin (biofuels), which can be used for the generation of heat or electricity.”
13  The Tracking SDG 7 report (IEA, IRENA, UNSD, World Bank, WHO 2022) distinguishes between modern 
and traditional use of biomass. Traditional biomass refers to solid biofuels like wood, charcoal 
and agricultural residues. It should be noted that exact data on the use of traditional biomass is 
scarce, as a lot of this type of energy is not traded and/or accounted for before combustion. By 
definition, the use of traditional biomass refers only to the residential sector in countries 
outside the OECD and thus Southeast Europe. IRENA (2019) shows that the majority of solid biofuels 
used in Southeast Europe can be interpreted in the traditional sense.

8 Status quo of renewable energy deployment in the UNECE region

Countries in Eastern Europe, Caucasus, Central Asia and the Rus- sian Federation consume almost all 
of their bioenergy in the form of solid biofuels. As such, Figure 3 does not include an additional 
indicator for purely solid biofuels (semi-transparent line) in these regions. Besides Southeast 
Europe, only Western and Central Europe and North America reduced the use of solid biofuels in 
recent years and instead, increased the share of modern bioenergy in TFEC.
Figure 5 indicates that the share of wind energy in TFEC remains small in all UNECE sub-regions but 
is constantly growing, espe- cially in Western and Central Europe and North America and recently in 
Southeast Europe and Central Asia also. Western and Central Europe exhibit the highest proportion 
with over 3% of TFEC in 2019.

Figure 4 shows that hydropower contributes a major share of renewable energy in TFEC not only in 
Southeast Europe but also in the Caucasus. Although subject to regular yearly fluctuations due to 
rain fall and increasing vulnerability to climate change, hydropower covers around 7% of the TFEC 
in both regions.
North America, Western and Central Europe, the Russian Feder- ation and Central Asia show similar 
regular patters; however, the share in TFEC is generally lower ranging between 2 to 5%.

The share of solar energy in TFEC ranges behind or is equal to that of wind power in all regions 
aside from Eastern Europe, as can been seen in Figure 6. However, the share continues to grow year 
on year in all regions except the Russian Federation, with Western and Central Europe leading at 
around 1.2% of TFEC in 2019.

Deployment of renewable energy in the power sector
Figures 7 to 10 show the recent renewable energy development in the UNECE region by depicting the 
installed electricity capacities of the most relevant renewable energy technologies in the UNECE 
region (PV, wind energy, bioenergy and hydropower) and the corresponding compound annual growth 
rate (CAGR)17.18 While markets for other renewable energy technologies exist, they do not exhibit 
relevant deployment figures. The respective column size illustrates the growth of the cumulated PV,

10 Status quo of renewable energy deployment in the UNECE region

PV, wind energy, bioenergy and hydropower contributed 1,200 GW to a total of 1,211 GW of renewable 
electricity capacity installed in the UNECE region in 2021. Wind energy and PV have been the two 
most rapidly expanding renewable energy technologies since 2018.

Between 2018 and 2021, wind energy capacity increased from 296 GW to 381 GW, resulting in a 
compound annual growth of 8.8%. In the same period, the PV sector expanded even more rapidly from 
180 GW to 297 GW, which equates to an annual growth of 18.3%.

In various countries, the modern use of biomass as a mean of generating electricity (as opposed to 
traditional uses such as burning timber) is either already established or new markets have recently 
begun to emerge in line with advancements in and availability of technology and improved bioenergy 
strategies and value chains. However, with 61 GW, bioenergy contributed the least to electricity 
generation capacity of the four examined technologies in 2021. The sector grew by a mean annual 
growth of 3.4%, from 57 GW in 2018 to 61 GW in 2021.

Throughout the UNECE region, hydropower capacity has grown less or even stagnated in recent years, 
resulting in capacity growth of only 0.6% annually. In some cases, as in the United States, the 
installed capacity even declined. Many UNECE coun- tries are already using much of their 
economically exploitable hydropower potential, leading to less dynamic market growth and fewer new 
installations. In the majority of UNECE countries, run-of-river plants, reservoir plants and mixed 
hydro plants make up a significant proportion of installations, together ac- counting for 90% of 
installed hydropower capacity in the region. Only in a few countries, like Belgium, pumped storage 
hydro dominates the total hydropower capacity.


Status of renewable energy in the heating sector
In contrast to renewable energy in the electricity sector, deploy- ment figures for renewable 
energy in the heating sector are far less granular. Globally, bioenergy is the main source for 
renew- able heat.21 Both globally and in the UNECE region, geothermal energy, solar thermal energy 
and concentrated solar power are less commonly used or established.

Despite the enormous theoretical potential, geothermal ener- gy is only exploited in some UNECE 
countries (e.g. Iceland and the United States). Solar thermal energy, on the other hand, is a more 
established source of renewable heat. Israel, Switzerland,
Türkiye and the United States have significant solar thermal markets and the technology is gaining 
importance in many other member states. Concentrated solar power plants for heat and/or power 
generation beyond the pilot or demonstration phase are
only relevant in the United States and Spain. Although far more established and significant in some 
member states, the renew- able heat sector in the UNECE region is far less developed than the 
sector for renewable electricity.




Why is renewable heat not as widely available as renewable electricity?

As established in section 1.2, energy for heating applica- tions accounts for the majority of TFEC 
both globally and in the UNECE region. Strategies for decarbonizing heating systems that go beyond 
the application of traditional bi- omass should therefore be high on the agenda of policy- makers.

However, as section 2.2 indicates, renewable heat is still lagging behind renewable electricity 
both in terms of technology deployment and general public awareness. There are two main reasons (in 
anticipation of section 3 Barriers and challenges to the uptake of
renewable energy):

First and foremost, renewable heating applications still lack economic viability in most UNECE 
member states. Higher LCOH (Levelised cost of heating) as well as prev- alent subsidies for fossil 
fuels diminish the competitive- ness of renewable heat technologies.22 However, as a result of the 
European energy crisis of 2021 and 2022, soaring fossil fuel prices are turning the economics in 
favour of renewables in the heating sector. Nevertheless, renewable heat technologies often face 
high upfront costs as well as investment risks, both of which impede their uptake in many regions. 
This is especially the case with geothermal heat, for instance.

Secondly, an effective renewable heat supply in densely populated areas also depends on 
availability of suitable infrastructure, namely district heating networks.
If this infrastructure is not available, „plug-and-play“- solutions common in the electricity 
sector, such as high-efficiency appliances, are not possible. High
upfront investment and ongoing maintenance is required in order to set up and run the required 
networks. In addition, building standards and energy efficiency regulations directly influence the 
viability of renewable heating solutions, adding to the complexity of their uptake and integration.

2.3  Dynamic Solar PV and Wind Energy Market Development

PV and wind energy markets have expanded dynamically between 2018 and 2021 in the UNECE region, 
with noticeably higher relative growth than other renewable energy sources. Given this significance 
and the actual and potential role that PV and wind energy has in meeting UNECE and global energy 
demand, this report analyses PV and wind energy deployment in greater detail.

Figures 11 and 12 display the recent development of PV and wind energy markets in the UNECE region 
at the member state level. The y-axis displays the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of installed 
electricity capacities of PV (Figure 11) and wind energy (Figure 12) as an indicator for the growth 
of the respective national PV and wind energy markets between 2018 and 2021. The x-axis shows the 
market share of each technology as a percentage of total national electricity generation capacity 
in 2021, representing market penetration. The charts are divided into four quadrants representing 
different stages of market de- velopment (as introduced in Table 2).
If a high CAGR prevails even if the technology’s market share has reached an above-median level, 
member states appear in Q1.
In these thriving markets, renewable capacity is added rapidly, expanding an already substantial 
generation fleet.

When the growth rate is below-median but a technology has an above-median market penetration, 
member states are displayed in Q4 with saturating markets. This is where established renew- able 
energy markets are located.

Of course, this qualification of market status is relative to the other UNECE member states, and 
thus does not follow a defini- tion that is constant over time. It also needs to be understood as a 
depiction of a point in time that does not reflect the fulfilment of renewable energy potential. 
Resource availability has not been considered in this analysis. Rather, the categorisation is a 
result of a member states recent market development.

Quadrant 3 – Underdeveloped markets below- median market share below- median growth rate
Quadrant 1 – Thriving markets above- median mar-
ket share above- median growth rate

Quadrant 4 – Saturating markets above- median mar-
ket share below- median growth rate

Table 2: Description of the four quadrants: market share and growth rate


Member states that have an insignificant share of PV or wind assets in their power generation fleet 
and below-median CAGR are found in quadrant 3 (Q3). These markets may be qualified as 
underdeveloped markets.

When a member state has added renewable energy generation capacities rapidly but still has a 
below-median market penetra- tion, it is found in Q2. Coming from a small fleet, extreme growth 
rates are easily attainable. As such, states with market shares below 1% were excluded from the 
graphs.23 Nevertheless, countries in this quadrant indicate a dynamic market develop- ment, 
qualifying them as emerging markets.


23 Countries with PV market shares below 1% are: Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iceland, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, 
Republic of Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, Russian Federation, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and 
Uzbekistan.
Countries with wind market shares below 1% are: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, 
Georgia, Iceland, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, Malta, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland, 
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

Figure 11: PV market growth in relation to PV’s share of total electricity generation capacity in 
the UNECE region in 2021, concentrated solar power excluded, on- and off-grid applications 
included24
¹Albania’s actual CAGR is 196.6%. For illustrational reasons, y-axis is limited to 150%.



When observing PV deployment in the UNECE region (Figure 11), the median25 market growth rate26 
between 2018 and 2021 reached 22.2%. The share of total electricity generation capaci- ty remained 
relatively low, at 9.8%, especially considering that markets with a PV penetration of less than 1% 
have already been excluded.

Poland, Estonia, Ukraine, Hungary, Spain, Cyprus and the Neth- erlands show high growth rates with 
significant market penetra- tion, therefore qualifying as thriving PV markets. For this anal-
ysis, comparing the solar PV market of Italy and Spain is par- ticularly insightful as the 
countries have comparable economic strength and resource availability (solar irradiation). 
Achieving a CAGR of 42.0% despite an already high market penetration
of 12.4%, Spain’s solar market likely still has large untapped potential. Italy, on the other hand, 
is among the saturating markets in Q4 with a significantly higher market penetration of 18.6% but a 
low CAGR. Different approaches to renewable energy policy making might explain this difference in 
market development.

24 Illustration based on IRENA (2022).
25  The median separates the higher half from the lower half of a data set. That means in the case 
of the PV market 50% of the states have a lower market share than 9.8% and 50% have a higher share. 
The CAGR and Figure 12 work analogously. The median is used in case of statistical outliers like in 
this situation. That means very high and very low numbers. Therefore, the average can be biased. In 
the case of the PV market very high CAGR like Albania’s raise the average and distort the correct 
assessment of the overall growth rates. The average would be 39.0% in contrast to the median at 
22.2%.
26 Note that the CAGR in Figure 11 and 12 differs from the CAGR in Figure 7 and 8. In the latter, 
CAGR was taken from total GW numbers whereas in Figure 10 and 11 CAGR is calculated for every 
country individually and then the median CAGR is taken.


13 Status quo of renewable energy deployment in the UNECE region

Despite only average growth and market penetration, Türkiye’s PV market is noteworthy as well. Just 
as did Poland, Türkiye had less than 20 MW installed PV capacity at the end of 2013. In the 
meantime, both markets have grown substantially over the years with 7.7 GW installed capacity in 
Poland and 7.8 GW in Türkiye.

UNECE countries with emerging PV markets include Kazakh- stan, Armenia, Albania, Portugal, North 
Macedonia, Ireland, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Finland and Sweden. Consid- ering resource 
availability (solar irradiation), it is unsurprising that countries in Northern Europe have 
relatively low PV market shares and are only recently beginning to take up this technology. 
Armenia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Kazakhstan, on the other hand, have 
only begun to tap into their abundant resources. Despite a mature market and high solar 
irradiation, Portugal still has high potential for substantial PV deployment.
Countries that are yet to deploy PV on a large scale include Türkiye,
Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, Denmark, Croatia, Canada
and Belarus, finding themselves in Q3 as underdeveloped PV markets. Given their good climatic 
preconditions (solar irradia- tion) for PV deployment, Croatia, Romania and Türkiye are 
particularly noteworthy in this context, with the latter recently showing significant growth (as 
mentioned above).

The United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Luxem- bourg, Israel, Greece, Italy, Belgium, 
Germany and Malta constitute the saturating PV markets in the UNECE region. All have high market 
penetration but relatively low market growth rates with Germany, Malta and Belgium showing the 
highest market shares in this quadrant between 24.4% and 25.7%.

14 Status quo of renewable energy deployment in the UNECE region

Looking at wind energy deployment in the UNECE region between 2018 and 2021 (figure 12), the median 
annual market growth rate was lower than that of PV (7.1% versus 22.2%).
However, in 2021, wind power had a higher median market share in the UNECE region (11.3%) than PV 
(9.8%).

Belgium, Greece, Sweden, the Netherlands, Croatia, France, Lith- uania, Norway as well as Finland 
show above-median growth rates in combination with above-median market shares. With-
in the UNECE region, these countries represent thriving wind power markets. Croatia is a 
particularly remarkable case, as it is the only non-Western and Central European country showing 
strong, above-median growth at a market penetration of 20.4%.

With 43.4%, Denmark has the highest market penetration of wind power, followed by Ireland with 
38.3%, but its market grew slightly less between 2018 and 2021 (CAGR of 4.7% and 5.6%,
respectively). As a result, it qualifies as a saturating wind power market, alongside Germany, 
Portugal, Spain, the United King- dom, Romania, Poland and Austria.

On the other side of the spectrum, several UNECE member states qualify as underdeveloped wind power 
markets with below-median market shares and below-median growth rates. Italy, Canada, Czech 
Republic, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Latvia, Estonia and Hungary fall into this category.

Countries with emerging wind power markets are beginning to tap into their wind resources with a 
below-median market share but above-median growth rate. Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of 
Moldova, Serbia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Türkiye and the United States belong 
to this group.

Figure 13: Installed PV and wind electricity capacity in UNECE countries24



Although useful for observing patterns and developments, growth rates and market shares do not 
provide information on total deployment figures. Figure 13 shows the ten UNECE mem- ber states with 
the largest installed PV and wind power capacities. Noteworthy is that all ten countries are in 
North America or Western and Central Europe with the exception of Türkiye (Central Asia). Not 
surprisingly, the United States leads on total deployment in both PV and wind power by a wide 
margin. This
is due to obvious reasons such as country and market size and resource potential, but also due to 
less obvious reasons such as political support, competition from other resources, availabil- ity of 
local expertise and supply chains, and others. Generally, the differences within the UNECE region 
are extreme. 27 mem- ber states (out of 53 in total with available data) hold 99% of the entire PV 
capacity installed in the UNECE region. Similarly, 24 states cover 99% of the total installed wind 
power capacity.

Barriers and Challenges to the Uptake of Renewable Energy






As section 2 has demonstrated, renewable energy is gaining traction in the UNECE region. However, 
deployment figures are still not in line with the required speed to reach a carbon-neutral energy 
system by 2050 and achieve the global climate targets. Various barriers hinder the market 
penetration of renewable energy throughout the region.

This section provides an overview of barriers and challenges in terms of political strategy, 
economic viability, infrastructural capacity and public acceptance. Although not exhaustive, the 
following challenges represent major, overarching issues that need to be addressed early on and 
throughout the transition to a sustainable energy system based upon renewable energy.


3.1  Lack of Long-term Energy Sector Strategy

Transitioning from a fossil-dominated, conventional energy system to a renewable energy-based one 
is a task for decades, not years. As energy and the provision of energy services are essential for 
a country’s society and economy, the transition to a sustainable, climate friendly energy system 
must be undertaken gradually, while maintaining a continuous balance of demand and supply at any 
given time. Major assets of the energy system and supporting infrastructure, including power plants 
and networks, need to be maintained, upgraded and enhanced, newly deployed or decommissioned. This 
all requires advanced planning and coordination and the establishment of a long-term, overarching 
energy sector strategy.

A comprehensive energy sector strategy sets out a vision for the sustainable supply of energy that 
meets expected demand with clear targets and timelines. This indicates a clear pathway for- ward 
and provides benchmarks that current and future political action can be checked against. A thorough 
assessment and understanding of the status quo and potential of the energy sector complements the 
vision. It is the prerequisite for successful regulatory interventions and requires the 
availability of reliable

statistical data. With the vision and status quo in place, a coun- try can then begin to develop 
strategies for the transition. This includes analysing and planning for required infrastructure and 
assets and their inherent interdependencies (e.g. generation additions and network connections). 
Building upon this, concrete policies can be drafted for the development of market structures that 
incentivize energy sector participants to act on achieving the vision and deploy the required 
technology.

Without such a comprehensive energy strategy, the use of resources and successful decision making 
and coordination amongst all relevant actors is less than optimal and thereby inefficient. 
Investment in necessary infrastructure is misguided, uncoordinated and lacking of long-term vision 
and planning.
Private sector involvement is limited as the lack of a fundamental and clear message from the 
central authority and government lowers investor’s confidence in the long-term viability of their 
investments. Subsequently, this leads to a lack of investment capital and higher interest rates, 
which in turn compromises the economic viability of projects (section 3.2) and timely develop- ment 
of the sector.

A comprehensive plan that aggregates energy sector data such as energy resource potentials, 
historical statistical trends
and sophisticated forecasting, together with qualitative and quantitative information, into a 
clearly formulated and evidence-based development pathway is required as it allows for sound 
decision-making and sector development. Although energy sector planning and strategies will have to 
be adapted to new developments such as advances in technologies or geopolitical events, a certain 
degree of regulatory stability is required and crucial to maintain the confidence of all energy 
sector stakeholders and ensure market development and the achievement of energy sector and climate 
targets.






16 Barriers and challenges to the uptake of renewable energy

3.1.1 Policy Implementation: Long-term Energy Strategy

When designing renewable energy policies, the following guiding questions can support successful 
establishment and implemen- tation of a sector-wide long term energy strategy:


■  Does the government have a vision for and a clear commitment to renewable energy?
■ Does a stable political framework exist?
■  How does infrastructure ownership affect market access? Different policies can be considered 
depending on whether ownership is private or public.
■ Is new infrastructure needed, or can existing infrastructure be upgraded or modernised?
■  What existing regulations and political realities affect market access for renewable energy? 
Market access for renewable heat, for example, is influenced by factors such as building 
regulations, energy efficiency regulations and technical standards.
■ Are permitting procedures clear and transparent, including the responsibilities of different 
public authorities? A ‘one shop stop’ approach for renewable energy projects is useful to reduce 
bureaucratic barriers and increase investors and project developers’ confidence.
■  Is there a clear enough understanding of energy demand and corresponding renewable generation? 
Energy mapping is important for accurately understanding electricity and heat consumption, and for 
connecting it with the highest possible share of renewable electricity and heat generation. In the 
case of heating, a certain amount might be covered by both renewable heat and excess heat from 
industry.
■  What policy options are already being implemented or are available on a local level? The local 
level is key to achieving decarbonisation goals, and often has a high degree of policy 
effectiveness.
■  What are neighbouring countries doing to increase their share of renewable energy? International 
coope- ration between neighbouring UNECE countries can lead to a more sustainable electricity and 
heat supply as the countries often face similar challenges. Country clusters and collaborations can 
produce joint strategies and measures.
■  Which ministries and public institutions on both natio- nal and provincial level need to be 
involved in the crea- tion, implementation and monitoring of renewable energy support schemes that 
connect various sectors including environment and climate, transport, agricul- ture, and finance? 
What are their responsibilities?
■  What role does innovation play in public procurement? When awarding concessions or public 
tenders, innova- tive approaches to and integration of renewable energy can play an important part 
in the selection criteria.
3.2  Lack of Economic Viability

As pointed out in section 2.1, the costs for renewable energy technologies have fallen dramatically 
over the last decade and subsequently economic viability for renewable energy projects has vastly 
improved. Despite these advances, renewable energy solutions are not yet sufficiently economically 
attractive to drive required levels of growth throughout the entire UNECE region.

A range of factors impede the economic viability of renewable energy projects. Lack of information 
or even misinformation, the relative immaturity of the sector and inexperience of relevant 
stakeholders (financial institutions, project developers, network operators, etc.) and limited 
access to investment capital and financial services all lead to higher perceived and actual costs 
for renewable energy projects. These factors are however not unique to the energy sector and often 
impact any innovative, nascent or developing technology.

Of particular and significant relevance to the economic viability of renewable energy investments 
is energy pricing, energy subsidies for conventional energy sources, and the means and methods by 
which costs of energy supply are socialised. Market- distorting subsidies (particularly for fossil 
fuels or electricity/ heat), misaligned taxes and levies as well as instable revenue flows hamper 
the economic viability of renewable energy. This results in a lack of a level playing field for 
renewable energy technologies and hinders market development.

Furthermore in many UNECE countries, currency and political risks lead to high interest rates, 
compromised project bankability and, subsequently, the unavailability of investment capital.


3.2.1 Energy Pricing and Subsidies

As the main contributing factor by which generation assets, including renewable energy generators, 
earn revenues and recuperate investment costs, electricity prices are a crucial factor for the 
successful deployment of renewable energy - they directly influence the economic viability of 
renewable energy investments.

Electricity prices are generally composed of electricity generation and supply costs, network 
charges, as well as various taxes a
nd levies such as sales, value-added taxes or renewable energy support levies. Electricity 
generation costs from all types of generating plants, both conventional and renewable, determine 
the electricity market price and, as the main component of electricity prices, they are decisive 
for the degree of economic viability of renewable energy generation.

Given the importance of energy access for quality of life and eco- nomic growth, and taking into 
account current socioeconomics, development goals and access to natural resources, governments 
strive and often struggle to find the best approach to energy and electricity pricing. Energy 
prices and costs for consumers, both

17 Barriers and challenges to the uptake of renewable energy

private households and businesses, often represent a considerable portion of household budgets or 
expenditures. As such, electricity pricing and the method by which costs for energy supply and 
energy infrastructure is socialised, has a direct effect on social acceptance of general and 
renewable energy policy, and the competitiveness of energy-intensive businesses and industries.

In order to enable access to energy to the most vulnerable and poor citizens, especially in 
developing nations, policy is often focussed on keeping energy prices as low as possible, even
if actual energy supply costs are not covered. This type of subsidization is also quite common in 
countries with plentiful, indigenous natural resources. Low energy prices however, incentivise 
consumption and production of fossil-fuels, distort market signals and impede discovery of actual 
energy supply and consumption costs. In addition, subsidizing energy costs often strains government 
budgets, increases debt in developing economies and also negates climate mitigation efforts and 
tools such as emission trading or carbon taxes.

The existence of subsidies and the level of subsidisation is not always easy to identify. The most 
common method for measur- ing consumption subsidies; the price-gap approach compares average 
end-user prices with reference prices for the full cost of supply. A subsidy is present if the 
price an end-user pays is below the reference price for the full cost of supply. However, extensive 
data from international organisations, local governments and
various organisations is required. Furthermore, costs of supply diverge greatly across the region 
and reference prices are based on international prices, thus making it difficult to accurately cal- 
culate the level of subsidisation.27 Nonetheless, in the absence of all required data, electricity 
prices that do not align with global or regional averages imply that fossil-fuel subsidies are in 
place.

Throughout the UNECE region, approaches to energy pricing policy, subsidisation and the 
socialisation of renewable energy expansion costs are varied. In the absence of holistic data and 
information on direct and indirect subsidies, observing electricity prices can provide insight into 
the different energy pricing policies of member states.

As can be seen in Figure 14 and Figure 15, electricity prices between UNECE member states diverge 
greatly for both house- holds (14) and for industrial consumers (15). In both figures, the y-axis 
displays the end-consumer electricity price in eurocents, including taxes and levies where data 
available, and relates it to the country’s GDP per capita, shown on the x-axis. A positive 
correlation between the prices end consumers pay and the GDP per capita of the respective country 
can be observed; wealthier or more developed economies generally pay more for electricity. 
Noteworthy, most countries in Southeast Europe are among the countries with the cheapest 
electricity, ranging well below the average and comparable economies.

Figure 15: UNECE electricity prices for industrial consumers in relation to GDP per capita in 
202028



Figures 16 and 17 show the electricity prices in the UNECE region for household and industrial 
consumers respectively in descending order and display both the full price charged to the consumer 
and its split into generation costs as well as added taxes and levies (where data available). As 
both graphics show, electricity generation costs, including network costs, range between 0.10€/ kWh 
and 0.15€/kWh in most UNECE member states. For member
states in Southeast Europe and Central Asia, the overall electricity costs are well below 0.10€/kWh 
in total, giving further indication that electricity prices may be artificially low in these 
countries.
As can been seen in Figure 17, electricity prices for industrial consumers are generally lower than 
those for households in all member states across the region. As energy costs make up a large 
portion of business expenditures and directly effect international competitiveness of whole 
industries, business consumers enjoy greater subsidies and tax exemptions for energy.

21 Barriers and challenges to the uptake of renewable energy

UNECE member states with artificially low electricity prices or subsidised electricity prices from 
conventional energy sources present a difficult starting position for the uptake of renewable 
energy. In the absence of energy prices that reflect actual costs of supply, renewable energy 
expansion is stifled as renewable energy investments cannot be amortised and there is therefore 
little or no incentive for market entry.

In order to foster the market for renewables, existing fossil-fuel subsidies should be reviewed. In 
addition, renewable energy support policies and promotion schemes can be utilised to aid economic 
viability and create markets for renewable energy technologies. However, running these schemes 
entail promotion costs, which are frequently redistributed in the form of taxes or levies that 
increase final consumer electricity prices. This may lead to social acceptance issues for renewable 
energy deployment and impact the competitiveness of industries. To aid expansion costs and 
especially where extensive fossil fuel subsidies exist, the costs of renewable energy promotion 
schemes can be covered through a reduction of fossil fuel subsidies and reallo- cation of national 
budgets. Furthermore, as observed in Section 2 above, the costs of renewable energy are expected to 
further decline in the medium term and become more affordable in all UNECE member states across the 
region, making subsidisation less necessary and aligning actual costs with consumer prices.

In the context of renewable energy deployment, electricity pricing constitutes an important 
trade-off between implemented renewable energy promotion schemes, social acceptance and the 
international competitiveness of local industries. Therefore, extensive analysis and monitoring of 
electricity pricing and policy is necessary for the successful uptake of renewable energy.

On a global scale, it is clear that renewable energy is becoming a competitive edge for attracting 
new industries and services. For companies, it is a matter of making new location decisions 
dependent on the local availability of affordable and CO₂-free electricity or energy. Against this 
background, it is an important opportunity for governments to adapt the framework for renewable 
energy to make their economies fit for the future.
3.2.2 Policy Implementation: Improving Economic Viability of Renewable Energy

When designing renewable energy policies the following guiding questions can support successful 
strategies and policies in the field of economic viability and financing.


■  What are the energy pricing aspects in the country? When considering the economic viability of 
renewable energy projects, it is important to review existing subsidies and market structures 
favouring fossil generation. Energy prices should reflect real costs, and include the negative 
environmental effects of generation, so that they can function as an incentive for renewable 
energy.
■  Are financial support schemes necessary to help with the uptake of renewable energy? Depending 
on technology and policy objective, a range of different approaches is available (section 4.1)
■ How easy is it to access financing and cover capital costs? These two aspects are crucial for the 
develop- ment of renewable energy projects. Local banks need to have the capacities and resources 
to finance renewable energy projects, especially in the face of high upfront costs.
■ Are loans from development banks such as the EBRD or the World Bank available? Having access to
these loans can help reduce financial costs, increase financial security and thereby make renewable 
energy projects feasible.
■  Are (high) import taxes and custom duties imposed on renewable energy technologies and 
components? High levies and taxes have a significant impact on the viability of renewable energy 
projects in countries that must import most of the necessary equipment.
■ What standards apply in the country? Having different standards in place may result in increased 
capital costs when entering new energy markets abroad.
■  How much bureaucracy is involved in implementing renewable energy projects? The difficulty and 
time involved in processing and receiving permits and licenses influences the economic viability of 
projects.
■  How stable is the local currency? Fluctuations and devaluations in local currencies are major 
challenges to the economic viability of renewable energy projects, especially if foreign investors 
are involved. This is because local currencies are often used to pay for the energy generated.








22 Barriers and challenges to the uptake of renewable energy

3.3  Lack of Infrastructural Capacity and Flexibility for Renewable Energy Integration

Another prevailing challenge in achieving a secure, stable and sustainable energy system is the 
successful integration of inter- mittent renewable energy resources into energy networks. In most 
UNECE member states, power grids still operate in the traditional way, meaning they deliver 
electricity from central sources of supply one-way to consumers. Integrating decentral renewables 
requires different grid operation methods, processes and technologies that enable bi-directional 
flows of electricity. In many countries, grid systems and equipment are not yet fit for this type 
of operation. In addition, renewable energy assets
frequently connect to distribution rather than transmission grids, putting additional strain on 
these low-voltage networks.
Although low levels of intermittent renewable energy resources can be received and accommodated by 
current networks, further expansion and integration of renewable sources with the most potential in 
most of the UNECE member states, namely solar
and wind, require considerable network upgrades and more advanced operation methods.

In that respect, virtually all UNECE countries face the task of upgrading their power and heating 
networks to account for increased shares of intermittent renewable resources and changes in 
operation. In addition to necessary network upgrades, increasing system flexibility through demand 
side management or renew- able flexible generation and storage can be utilised. Demand
side management methods modify customer demand patterns through education or by incentivising 
customers (private, com- mercial and industrial) to shift their power demand requirements to either 
increase or reduce load, which helps prevent the curtailment of renewable energy and increases 
system stability.

Flexible renewable generation, such as pumped hydropower plants and battery storage systems can 
help to balance out fluctuations in the energy generated from renewable sources. Due to technical 
constraints, nuclear, coal and other fossil-fuelled power plants are mostly not capable of 
providing the necessary flexibility to provide dynamic grid stabilising services.

While the level of electrification is generally high and power networks are available and reach a 
large majority of the population in the UNECE region, district heating networks are far less common 
or expansive. In many countries, decentral heat generation prevails, leading to different 
challenges when
integrating renewable energy. Existing networks and systems can be converted or adapted to utilise 
a range of renewable technol- ogies such as heat pumps, biomass, biogas, geothermal energy, 
large-scale solar thermal heat plants with seasonal storage, and waste-to-energy plants. However, 
depending on the technology and existing infrastructure, a range of challenges may persist which 
require holistic solutions.



23 Barriers and challenges to the uptake of renewable energy
3.3.1 Policy Implementation: Developing Infrastructural Capacity and Flexibility for Renewable 
Energy Integration

When designing renewable energy policies the following guiding questions can support successful 
strategies and policies in the field of infrastructural capacity and flexibility for renewable 
energy integration.


■ Is there an accurate monitoring system in place? Predicting and forecasting energy supply and 
demand helps to balance power grids and integrate intermittent renewable energy such as wind and 
solar.
■ What standards are in place? Do they comply with international standards? Standards on matters 
such as integrating renewable energy into existing grids are important. They need to be properly 
designed and implemented, and should take account of different
system requirements (grid codes, licensing procedures, etc.). Currently, standards vary from 
country to country, which hampers the cross-border use of renewable energy and excess heat. 
International standards can help improve cross-border energy use and thus make the overall energy 
supply system more efficient.
■ Does the country already produce a large amount of renewable electricity? Technologies that link 
different energy sectors offer new possibilities for sustainably generating heating energy. 
Efficient biomass waste-
to-energy plants make it possible to combine heat and electricity supplies while also solving waste 
disposal problems.
■  What are the plans for increasing energy efficiency? It is important to look at the targets for 
energy efficiency
when forecasting future heat demand, as an increase in efficiency will reduce demand.
■ Do connections with neighbouring countries exist? Such connections can be beneficial when it 
comes to balancing the electricity grid and using natural resources efficiently on an international 
level.
■  What laws and regulations govern land use? It is impor- tant to be able to assess the 
availability and quality of resources, but this has proven difficult in some UNECE countries 
(analysing geothermal potential is one example). Particularly in densely populated areas, renewable 
electricity and heat are competing for space and land use rights.
■  Do heating networks exist? Especially in urban areas, heating networks can be the backbone of a 
low-carbon or zero-carbon heating supply. Hence, the existence of inefficient district heating 
networks, a lack of heating networks, or efforts to dismantle networks are obsta- cles to 
developing renewable heat. Plans for heating networks must consider both renewable and excess heat 
supply and demand, and future gains in efficiency. Many heating networks still work with very high 
tempe- ratures from conventional heat generation. However,


renewable heat technologies and excess heat pro- ducers can supply heat via low-temperature heating 
networks.
■  Does the country have sufficient expertise to operate renewable heat and excess heat supply 
systems? There are many possibilities in the UNECE region, such as using waste heat from oil 
refinery processes, geothermal heat and heat from bioenergy for industry, agriculture and public 
buildings.




3.4  Lack of Public Acceptance and Awareness

If renewable energy is to become an integral part of a country’s energy system, then awareness, 
knowledge and capacities among all relevant stakeholders are vital. Given the different levels of 
deployment between countries with advanced renewable energy markets and those at an earlier stage 
of renewable development, mutual learning, knowledge transfer, capacity building and cooperation 
will be fundamental to help accelerate the uptake of renewables throughout the region.
Lack of awareness is one of the main obstacles to greater renewable deployment in many parts of the 
UNECE region, especially
when the implementation of renewable energy technologies results in increased costs and electricity 
prices for consumers. The general population, businesses and even (local) govern- ments are 
sometimes unaware of the potential and (economic) viability of renewable energy sources. This may 
result in a lack of public acceptance of renewable technologies – a situation that can be further 
aggravated by a relatively small number and low visibility of best-practice examples. Such local 
reference points, communicated via public programmes, for instance, play an important role in 
raising awareness. As mentioned above,
a comprehensive energy sector strategy that is shared and communicated with all stakeholders, 
including the greater public, is essential to raise awareness and acceptance of the benefits
of renewable energy.

Within the UNECE region, awareness about the advantages of renewable heat, for instance, is also 
clearly still lacking, while the disadvantages of a fossil heating supply (such as health risks, 
particularly from old, inefficient and polluting stoves) are frequently overlooked. Raising 
awareness about the opportunities and benefits of renewable energy is vital, though often quite 
difficult in practice.




































24 Barriers and challenges to the uptake of renewable energy

3.4.1 Policy Implementation: Acceptance and Awareness Raising

When designing renewable energy policies the following guiding questions can support successful 
strategies and policies in the field of acceptance and awareness raising.


■ Does the country have any flagship or demonstration projects in place? To increase awareness and 
encou- rage a positive social perception of energy from renewable sources, official commitments by 
public decision-makers and the existence of visible and symbolic flagship projects matter a great 
deal.
Target groups include installers (especially in countries where basic knowledge is lacking), 
consultants such as energy auditors, final consumers, policymakers, public administrators, and 
opinion leaders in the media and civil society.
■  Can individuals actively profit of renewable energy deployment? Prosumer schemes, investment 
oppor- tunities for the public and favourable electricity procurement contracts for communities 
close to project sites can strongly improve public acceptance (see section 4)
■  What myths and misperceptions exist around the functioning and effects of renewable energy? 
Awareness campaigns help in debunking myths and drawing attention to the importance and viability 
of renewable energy. Sound scientific studies and demonstration projects can also help reduce fears 
and concerns among the population.
■  What is the level of public acceptance for renewable energy? Even if awareness for renewable 
energy is high, public acceptance for the deployment and promotion schemes may not be. Public 
sector institutions and individuals should take a leading role in promoting the benefits of 
renewable energy.
■  What role can education play in creating social acceptance and public awareness? Which Technical 
and Vocational Education and Training curricular exist in the country that include renewable energy 
themes? Educating the population on renewable energy can be a crucial task. Education policies and 
information on environmental integrity and climate change are essential elements of a comprehensive 
awareness-raising strategy.
■ Are any dialogue formats in place for exchanging ideas and good practices with other countries? 
Schemes that encourage dialogue between different countries raise own and foreign performance and 
allow each country to gain knowledge about efforts and

progress elsewhere. A country with little renewable energy capacity might be more likely to set 
expansion targets, enact policies and launch programmes to foster renewable energy if other 
countries with similar needs and in comparable circumstances have already done so. Furthermore, 
exchanging informa- tion on what worked and what did not work could make it much easier to draw up 
effective policies.
■  Is there any scope for tapping into international cooperation programmes? A wealth of 
international cooperations, collaborations and programmes exist that can be tapped into and used to 
increase know- ledge and awareness about renewable energy. Exchange programmes, train-the-trainer 
program- mes and other capacity-building schemes can be a major boost to sharing information, 
increasing knowledge and driving renewable energy deployment.
■  How can national or local civil society organisations become partners to increase awareness 
about the benefits of renewable energy among the population?

Renewable Energy Policymaking in the UNECE Region
4.1  General Introduction to Renewable Energy Policymaking

Renewable energy promotion schemes and support policies aim to facilitate market entry, system 
integration and market growth of renewable energy by addressing barriers and challenges as 
identified in Chapter 3. While some policies and measures may be focussed and aim to address 
specific challenges, such as expansion targets or rebates for specific technologies to improve 
economic viability, other policies may be more broad and address multiple challenges, such as 
targets or quotas for the uptake and consumption of renewable energy system wide. Table 3 
summarises the most common renewable energy support policies and measures and the main challenges 
and barriers they aim to address.



Promotion Scheme
Description
Primary Focus


Official Targets for Renewables
Defines and officially communicates binding or non-binding targets and goals for the expansion and 
use of renewable energy. Targets may be technology or sector specific.
Energy sector strategy, economic viability, acceptance


Guarenteed / Priority Access
Providing all technical and regulatory requirements are met, network operators are required to gu- 
arantee and prioritise grid connection and access to new renewable installations.
Economic viability, integration


Priority Dispatch
Priority dispatch is guaranteed for renewable generators whereby grid operators are obligated to 
prioritise the feed-in and dispatch of renewable electricity from renewable generators ahead of 
conventional generators.
Economic viability, integration


Net Metering / Net Billing
Net billing and net metering mechanisms promote self-consumption of distributed generation. Re- 
newable electricity system owners are credited for the net value between the electricity they feed 
into the grid and electricity they use. Electricity surpluses can be remunerated as credit for 
future electricity demand (net metering) or as direct financial compensation at an agreed rate or 
tariff (net billing).
Economic viability, acceptance


Feed-in Tariff (FiTs) or Feed-in Premium (FiPs)
Administratively set pricing instrument that remunerates producers for feeding renewable electri- 
city into the grid. The feed-in of electricity is either remunerated with a fixed tariff (FiTs) or 
at mar- ket prices supplemented with a variable market premium (feed-in premium).
Economic viability


Quotas & Obligations (renewable portfolio standards, renewable obligations)
Quotas and Obligations set and define the minimum share of renewable energy required in the energy 
mix of power utilities and electricity and fuel providers. Quota systems are often combined with 
trading systems that use green certificates or renewable energy certificates. Such quotas may also 
apply to large consumers.
Energy sector strategy, economic viability


Tradable Renewable Energy Certificates (REC)
RECs are tradable, non-tangible commodities that represent a unit of generated renewable energy 
from an eligible generator, which are often used in combination with quota systems. The certifica- 
tes are issued for each unit of renewable electricity (usually MWh) that is generated and supplied.
Economic viability


Auctions / Tenders
A renewable energy auction is a competitive process for the procurement of renewable electricity 
generation, whereby project developers compete for long-term supply contracts based primarily on 
the lowest price of energy provision. Auctions can be designed to promote transparent procure- ment 
and competitive prices, in addition to other system and policy specific goals, such as system 
flexibility or the development of local industries and expertise.
Energy sector strategy, economic viability, integration


Other Financial Incentives
Financial or fiscal incentives such as credit grants, lower interest rates, tax credits or 
exemptions, and soft loans are designed to improve access to capital, reduce financing costs and 
otherwise re- duce upfront costs of renewable energy systems and efficiency measures or processes. 
Typical ex- amples include subsidies for electric vehicles or tax-exemptions for equipment used in 
large scale renewable energy projects.
Economic viability

26 Barriers and challenges to the uptake of renewable energy

The success of each scheme depends on various factors. On the one hand, policies need to be 
predictable, consistent and steady over the long term in order to create stable market conditions 
and planning security for all stakeholders, including plant opera- tors, investors and end 
consumers.31 On the other hand, the effec- tiveness of renewable energy policies strongly depends 
on their applicability within the existing energy market structure. Also, as multiple renewable 
energy promotion policies often run in par- allel, their combined effect needs to be considered and 
moni- tored in order to avoid any undesirable effects such as excessive cross-subsidisation or 
technological lock-in.

The following subsections 4.2 and 4.3 examine the current state of renewable energy policy 
implementation in the electricity and heat sector in the UNECE region.
4.2  Policies Promoting Renewable Electricity in the UNECE Region

As shown in section 2.2, market shares of renewable electricity generation capacity grew rapidly in 
several UNECE member states in the past years. This is a result of the successful intro- duction of 
regulation and support for renewable energy. Figure 18 shows the current stage of implementation 
for the renewable energy promotion schemes in the electricity sector. Only two out of 52 analysed 
countries – Turkmenistan and Iceland - have no policies specifically promoting the use of 
renewables.32 All other member states have a variety of policies in place that sup- port market 
entry, integration and growth of renewable energy. It should be noted though, that the figure only 
provides a quan- titative analysis as there is no statement about the quality of the policies 
implemented.

Figure 18: Renewable energy promotion schemes and measures in the electricity sector in UNECE 
member states33



Out of the 52 analysed countries, 46 have official, and to a certain extent, technology-specific 
renewable energy expansion goals. Guaranteed or prioritised grid access exists in 35 countries 
while projects receive priority dispatch in 36 countries. In 31 countries both policies are 
implemented whereas in nine countries, only one of the two policies are in place. Out of 15 
countries
which have implemented quotas or obligations, only Poland, Kyrgyzstan and the United States have 
neither guaranteed /prioritised access to grid nor priority dispatch. In summary, 43 countries have 
at least one of the three policies - prioritised grid access, priority dispatch and/or 
quotas/obligations - installed. Twenty- two UNECE member states have policies for net metering or 
net billing. Feed-in-tariffs or –premiums are in place in 39 countries.
Eleven countries have introduced tradable renewable energy certificates alongside their quota 
system, while 12 have introduced certificates trading without establishing a quota system. Auctions 
are increasingly used to determine the market value of renewable energy and have been introduced in 
35 national energy markets.

Finally, a large majority – besides Iceland, Turkmenistan and Bosnia and Herzegovina - use tax 
reductions and other financial (investment) incentives to promote renewable energy in the 
electricity sector. In combination with official expansion goals, both policies are implemented in 
45 countries.

4.3  Policies Promoting Renewable Heat in the UNECE Region

Figure 20 gives an overview of UNECE countries that have intro- duced policy and regulatory 
measures as well as financial support schemes for promoting renewable energy in the heat market. 
The first column indicates whether the country generally has policy and/or regulatory measures 
promoting renewables in the heat market independent of financial support. It covers policies and 
laws encouraging the deployment of renewables,
e.g. laws that demand solar thermal heating installations on the roof of new buildings. The second 
column indicates whether at least one financial support scheme is in place, and the three remaining 
columns show which renewable heat technologies are specifically supported.

Support may take the form of subsidies, low interest loans, tax regulations or a combination 
thereof. Support funds do not necessarily have to be from the member state governments but could 
also be from foreign sources, e.g. the EBRD. The schemes implemented are of permanent nature, 
meaning at least several years. One-time or pilot projects do not qualify as pro-
motion schemes. Promotion by the state only for public facilities are not considered.

Policies and support schemes can be available for either private households or companies. It should 
be noted, that the figure gives an impression about the number of member states with promotions 
schemes in the UNECE region but does not say anything about the quality thereof. This has several 
implications. First, some countries have already established renewable heating
at a large scale and therefore do not directly or specifically promote it anymore. Israel, for 
example, where solar thermal heating has been obligatory for new buildings since 1980, was one of 
the first countries to introduce such policies. Second, promoting all technologies does not 
necessarily mean better support for renewable heating. The aforementioned policy lead to 85% of 
Israeli households using solar thermal heating, indicating that focussing on only one technology 
can be successful. Furthermore, geographical circumstances need to be considered. Understandably, 
countries in the southern hemisphere focus on solar thermal whereas it is not as common in northern 
countries.

Having this in mind, out of 52 analysed UNECE countries, 34 promote renewable heating technology at 
the political and financial level. Six countries promote either one or the other. In the vast 
majority of cases, if financial support is given, countries promote all three technologies. Heat 
from solar thermal energy receives support in 35 member states, directly followed by biogas/ 
biomass, which is promoted in 34 member states. Geothermal energy and heat pumps are supported in 
33 member states.

A comparison of existing promotion schemes for renewable heat and renewable electricity generation 
reveals that governments currently mainly focus on promoting renewable energy in the electricity 
sector. Renewable heat is still a policymaking niche despite the great potential for renewable heat 
in the UNECE region (see info box in section 2.2). Given that all member states are situated in the 
Northern Hemisphere, there is high demand for heating applications.

30 Barriers and challenges to the uptake of renewable energy







Policy Implementation in Progress: Renewable Energy Hard Talks







For policy and policy implementation to be successful, it is important to understand the current 
and future potential challenges and available solutions, as well as the goals to be achieved.

Dialogue with all stakeholders is important to better understand the many aspects for 
consideration. Stakeholder workshops, discussion and continuous communication is essential for 
sound policy making. To aid this process in the UNECE region, a series of stakeholder workshops, 
so-called Renewable energy “Hard Talks” were held as part of the UNECE RE-Uptake Project in 2021 
and 2022. Renewable Energy Hard Talks were held with four different UNECE member countries: 
Albania, Georgia, Serbia
and the Republic of Moldova.


5.1  Concept of the Hard Talks

Hard Talks in brief
The “Hard Talk” is a discussion format on current topics of renewable energy held with relevant 
stakeholders of the partici- pating member states of the United Nations Economic Commission for 
Europe (UNECE) and organized by the UNECE secretariat and partner organizations.

The goal of the Hard Talk is to identify the best methods for realizing the potential of renewable 
energy by identifying key barriers that block private sector investment, as well as creating a 
well-functioning and stable system for the development of renewable energy.

The multi-stakeholder dialogues are organized by the UNECE
in collaboration with host countries, local partners and interna- tional organizations such as the 
European Union, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), 
REN21 (Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century), and dena (German Energy Agency).

Hard Talks involve all interested government agencies, parliament, private investors, energy 
producers and consumers, financial
and research institutions, NGOs, and international organizations.

Key players in the field of energy discuss key issues, deter- mine priorities and offer concrete 
policy recommendations to overcome political, legal, regulatory, and technical barriers and to 
access the untapped potential of renewable energy.

They aim to:
■  Investigate barriers that hinder the full unfolding of renewable energy potential in the host 
country.
■  Facilitate the exchange between political decision makers, project developers, investors and 
technolo- gy providers and thus between the public and priva- te sector.
■ Highlight and prioritise solutions to improve the in- vestment climate for renewable energy and 
to foster discussion on what the UNECE can provide with simi- lar initiatives.

Each of the four countries in focus for the UNECE RE-Uptake Project 2021 exhibit vastly different 
energy systems, from available natural resources and energy mix, to market structure and stage of 
energy transition. Despite the many differences, common themes and issues and their corre- sponding 
solutions are evident in each of the four host countries, demonstrating that main influencing 
factors to pave the way for renewable energy uptake are fundamen- tally the same, even if different 
policy frameworks apply.
Moreover, the discussions in all four Hard Talks have proven that the experience and good practices 
associated with addressing those common, largely identical influencing factors are transferable 
from one country to another.
Therein lays the added value of the Hard Talks: mobilising both international and regional 
experience to address local challenges and drive sustainable reform.


5.2  Hard Talk Process

As with any dialogue and open discussion format, coopera- tion with and involvement of relevant 
stakeholders is essential. For the Renewable Energy Hard Talks, the initial


31 Policy implementation in progress: Renewable Energy Hard Talks

identification and then collaboration with host partner organisa- tions, such as ministries and 
energy agencies, ensures that topics of interest and relevance can be discussed and defined, and 
the relevant stakeholders identified and involved in the process.

The identification of known challenges and potential solutions together with host partner 
organisations prior to the event is central to an effective discussion and practical dialogue. 
Before the event, a review of the renewable energy situation in the host country is undertaken with 
the view to identify issues which hinder the uptake of renewable energy sources. Ideally, recom- 
mendations and possible solutions based on international experience and good practices that address 
the focus topics and identified challenges are formulated and shared with the Hard Talk 
participants prior to the event.

During the event, specific guests and all participants are invited to provide input and their 
perspectives on the identified challenges and recommendations and further share additional 
information on other challenges, solutions or ideas. The identi- fied challenges, solutions and 
discussion are then brought together to produce a discussion and recommendation paper that details 
the main issues and recommendations. This is then shared for review and finalised with input from 
the Hard Talk par- ticipants and organising team. The final document is then pub- lished and shared 
with all interested parties to serve as a basis for further discussion and work on the topics and 
challenges therein.

Note that the country analysis, identified challenges and pro- posed recommendations are made at 
the approximate time of each Hard Talk and may not reflect the most recent country developments.



5.3  RE Hard Talk with Albania: Uptake, Integration and Harmonisation of Renewables in Albania

Within the context of the UNECE RE-Uptake 2021 project, the first of four UNECE Renewable Energy 
Hard Talks was held with Alba- nia remotely on the 6th and 7th of July 2021. Key issues, challeng- 
es, solutions and recommendations regarding network integra- tion, renewable policy support and 
bankability of renewable projects were discussed and refined.

With more than 130 participants over two days, the Hard Talk featured presentations, interventions 
and discussion from a wide variety of Albanian and international energy sector stakeholders, 
including: the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (MIE)
Albania, National Agency of Natural Resources (AKBN - Agjencia Kombëtare e Burimeve Natyrore), 
Albanian Power Corporation (KESH - Korporata Elektroenergjitike Shqiptare), Energy Regulatory 
Authority Albania (ERE), Transmission System Operator (OST), Electricity Distribution System 
Operator
(OSHEE), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), International Renewable Energy 
Agency (IRENA), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), German Federal Ministry 
for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), Deutsche Industrie- und Handelsvereinigung (DIHA) Albania, 
Statkraft, Uniper, Voltalia, and others.

The Hard Talk is intended to speed up existing processes to further progress renewable energy 
deployment, diversification and security of supply and the development of an attractive market for 
renewable energy in Albania. The Hard Talk focussed on the following main topics and leading 
questions:

■  Network Integration: What needs to be done to integrate and harmonise renewables within the 
network?
■ RE Support: How can current support mechanisms for rene- wable energy deployment be strengthened 
and improved?
■  Project Development: How can bankability of project ideas and proposals be improved?


5.3.1 Country Introduction

Albania has one of the largest shares of renewable energy in its energy mix in South-East Europe 
but is also a net energy importer and thus heavily reliant on imports. The renewable energy share 
in Albania is predominantly hydropower of which accounts for 95% of all generating capacity, with 
the remaining divided between solar (1%) and crude oil (4%) as of 2021. The heavy reliance on 
hydropower also means that renewable generation is sensitive to rain-fall, which has seen 
considerable annual variations and a steady decline in recent years. This is likely to further 
decline with the effects of climate change. In addition to hydropower resources, Albania also has 
abundant solar and wind resources, which are almost entirely untapped. In order to improve the 
energy security and climate resilience and to meet growing energy demand, it is imperative that 
Albania accelerates the transition to those abundant, available and local, renewable energy 
sources.


32 Policy implementation in progress: Renewable Energy Hard Talks

5.3.2 Challenges and Recommendations


Main Issue / Challenge

Renewable Energy Zoning






Comprehensive energy master plan




Strengthening of the distribution network












RE requirements and Balance Responsibilities

Strengthening support mechanisms for renewable energy

Description

Planning and economic resource analysis for solar and wind is lacking, thus hindering policy 
development and the setting of realistic targets, appropriate sizing of solar and wind auctions, 
and least-cost power system planning.




The current National Energy Sector Strategy 2030, National Renewable Energy Action Plan 2018-2020, 
and the Gas Master Plan serve to guide Albania’s energy sector. A holistic, least-cost plan that 
aggregates sub-sectoral plans is lacking.


Power generation from renewable energy sources fluctuates and is naturally variable. This requires 
more advanced and modern network infrastructure and operation that can handle bidirec- tional 
energy flows and changing supply profiles. Particularly in high-demand urban areas, the Albanian 
distribution grid lacks sufficient capacity and dynamic operation to handle variable electricity 
injection. This severely hampers the successful integ- ration of renewable energy sources in the 
country.








The current law regarding Balance Responsibility is not clear and thus requires refinement.


Fiscal incentives and policies such as feed-in-tariffs (FiT) or premiums (FiP) and tax reductions 
comprise the main sup- porting mechanisms to attract investments in renewables. The current support 
mechanisms and associated processes in Albania could be revised and improved.

Recommendations

■ RE zones should be developed in accordance with analysis of resource potential, grid access and 
ability to receive renewa- ble inflows, geographic and environmental aspects, proximity to demand, 
etc.
■ RE zoning could also consider an integrated approach to renewable energy development together 
with land use for Agriculture, especially when considering large-scale photo- voltaic (PV) plants.
■ A comprehensive plan that aggregates energy sector data such as renewable energy zoning, energy 
resource potentials and historical statistical trends, together with qualitative and quantitative 
information, into a clearly formulated and evi- dence-based development pathway will allow for 
sound deci- sion-making and sector development.
■ Refurbishment of the distribution grid around main load centres of Tirana and Durres.
■ Further expansion of the HV and MV grid, including intercon- nection capacities.
■ Planning and upgrading for an active grid that can handle bidirectional flows is required and 
should include equipment for safety of data.
■ Flexibility studies could be carried out to support the planning.
■ Monitoring of RE generation and input is required.
■ Improving energy parameters, technical loses and voltage levels.
■ Implementation of new technologies such as GIS, SCADA, HPPS monitoring should be considered.
■ Improved forecasting.
■ Limits or threshold capacity may be required to avoid too severe a reduction of gross income for 
balancing parties.
■ Value-added tax (VAT) reduction on all equipment and machi- nery required for renewable energy 
technologies.
■ FiT methodology improvement to adhere to the Albanian market, not based on the Hungarian power 
exchange (HUPEX).
■ Large consumers are currently exempt from paying levies. Renewable energy obligation should be 
extended to all consumers, not just those connected to the distribution grid.
■ The current methodology for the Net-Metering scheme is unclear and therefore requires revision:
• Adapt the net-metering scheme to enable all prosumers to benefit.
• Create a breakdown of different obligations for different types of network users such as IPP or 
autoproducers / prosumers in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP).














33 Policy implementation in progress: Renewable Energy Hard Talks




















Establishing a dedicated renewable energy agency


Facilitating financing of bankable project proposals













Raising public awareness on the benefits of renewable energy

Enhancing institu- tional capacities and local human resources



















A dedicated renewable energy agency could inform the coordi- nated development of renewables in 
line with national and international targets and obligations, including the timely development of 
new infrastructure, human resources and legislation with a view to meeting future energy demands in 
a sustainable and least-cost development pathway.
Many renewable project proposals for FiT or during auction bidding rounds are not approved and 
labelled as “unbankable”. Sufficient documentation on technical and pre-feasibility assessments is 
often lacking of the necessary information independently from the quality of the project proposal.












There is a current lack of knowledge of incentives and support. Awareness raising and the provision 
of information on the available renewable energy options, incentives and support programs can 
advance the perspectives of energy consumers and consequently renewable energy uptake.
Dedicated renewable energy training and education at vocatio- nal, tertiary and technical levels is 
lacking. Such investment and nurturing of human resources and expertise is required to maxi- mise 
and ensure the development of local economies.
■ Simplification and streamlining of permitting and approval processes for generation of renewables 
and grid connection:
• Shortening of period for giving permissions.
• Limit number of third parties.
• Current maintenance requirements are too onerous and should be revised.
■ The model for the Contract for Difference (CfD) system is not yet approved and should be 
finalized.
■ There is a lack of legislation addressing heating and cooling in buildings, e.g. no minimum 
requirements for renewables. As a first step, clear targets should be set together with suffici- 
ent planning.
■ Intensifying of use of renewable in end use sectors – Trans- port Sector:
• Incentivise electro mobility use (through rebates, tax incentives, etc.).
• Increase number of charging points.
■ Development of demand side management.

■ A dedicated renewable energy agency not considered by all as a priority as current efforts and 
initiatives should focus on implementation.



■ Available resources and best practices should be observed, utilised and maintained by the private 
sector and public institutions.
■ Standardisation of documentation based on best practices.
■ Development of financial instruments, decarbonisation policies.
■ Strict monitoring, project compliance and standards and safeguards will help reduce perceived 
project risk.
■ Policy commitment, including RE targets, auction schedules, clear and creditable institutional 
arrangements and a robust legislative and contractual framework is required.
■ Auction design could be improved and should include: details on location, volume, technology, 
eligibility and selection criteria; promotion of project delivery; support provision; fair risk 
allocation; and off-taker arrangements.
■ In addition to private promotional efforts, government sup- ported and initiated 
awareness-raising efforts and strategies can provide necessary information and confidence for grea- 
ter adoption.

■ Educational programmes. including education in schools for RE is required and should be pursued.
■ The introduction of renewable energy training programmes and a focus on specific areas such as PV 
should be prioritised in order to realise benefits as soon as possible.
■ There should be a focus on the development of skills required for PV installation and energy 
auditors.

5.4  RE Hard Talk with Georgia: Building Sup- port for Renewable Energy Investments in Georgia

The Renewable Energy Hard Talk dedicated to Georgia was held virtually on the 12th and 13th of 
October 2021 and focused on building support for investments in renewable energy in Georgia.

With 75 participants across the two days, the Hard Talk featured presentations, perspectives and 
highly interactive discussions amongst all participants. Participants represented all major 
stakeholder groups and various geographies, including: the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable 
Development of Georgia (MoESD), Parliament of Georgia, Ministry of Finance of Georgia, Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Agriculture, Georgian Energy Exchange (GENEX), National Statistics 
Office of Georgia (GEOSTAT), Georgian Energy Development Fund (GEDF), United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Asian 
Devel- opment Bank (ADB), World Experience for Georgia, ISET Policy Institute, United Nations 
Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), Georgian Renewable Energy Development Association 
(GREDA), Green Alternative, Energy Efficiency Centre (EEC), Tbili- si Transport Company, Helios 
Energy, Infinity Energy LLC, among others.

The Hard Talk focused on ways to increase support and attrac- tiveness for investments in RE in 
Georgia, by looking into the pol- icy landscape, market structure and public support for the 
sector. The aim was to (1) mobilise stakeholders (local and external) to discuss concrete actions 
and increase their individual and collec- tive impact, and (2) provide recommendations to actors in 
and outside Georgia, which could help bolster investment in RE. For this, key bottlenecks, drivers 
to change, solutions and recom- mendations were explored.


5.4.1 Country Introduction

Georgia’s energy mix is based on hydropower, biofuels and waste as well as fossil fuel imports 
(natural gas, oil, and coal). The en- ergy sector is heavily dependent on imported natural gas, 
which is the dominant energy source used in Georgia, followed by oil. The country has significant 
hydro potential and is among the top countries in the world by water resource per capita, while 
cur- rently only 20-22% of this potential is utilised. There is also a lot of untapped potential 
from wind, solar, geothermal and biomass resources.

Georgia has made substantial progress towards the liberalisation of the electricity and gas 
markets, improvements in cross-bor- der infrastructure and regional trade, as well as the 
transition
to a low carbon energy future in the past decade. Although the country’s energy security has been 
improving with the domestic
hydro generation, the supply-demand gap keeps growing due to increasing electricity demand and 
relatively limited local RE pro- duction. In 2019, high imports were needed to meet domestic demand 
for electricity generation even in the summer. Attracting more investments is needed to reduce 
dependency on imports by creating an enabling environment for RE.

Although considerable private investments in hydropower plants have been realised, the investment 
climate needs further improvement by creating a stable regulatory regime and estab- lishing clear 
RE targets by technology. Streamlining secondary legislation would enable the energy market to 
function efficiently, gradually moving out of a state-heavy energy sector. Clear price signals, 
along with transparent and competitive market rules would further encourage investments in 
renewable energy.
Strong local opposition has also been a barrier against the completion of ongoing RE projects in 
the country. Enhancing investments in RE will, therefore, require improvements in policy 
mechanisms, market structures, along with the public attitudes towards and support of RE.


5.4.2 Challenges and Recommendations

An extensive list of challenges and potential solutions/recom- mendations discussed during the Hard 
Talk, can be found below. The main takeaways include:

■  Establish a long-term policy strategy, setting longer-term (technology specific) RE targets that 
will provide clear signals to investors.
■  Improve existing and introduce new RE support schemes. There is a need for flexible, 
technology-based support mechanisms, with the ability to accommodate dynamic changes in the market.
■  Provide stable and transparent market rules. With the market reform underway, a transitional 
action plan that supports investors, as the pricing mechanism becomes clearer, would increase 
investors’ confidence.
■  Develop a tactical, long-term communication strategy involving various stakeholder groups to 
overcome social opposition. Promote communication campaigns and social engagement in RE project 
implementation.
■  Intensify capacity building activities through the deve- lopment of local education programs. 
Update existing curricula to introduce students to the new technologies and skills required and 
encourage the collaboration between universities and industry.
■ Convene regular multi-stakeholder discussions to ad- vance the renewable energy agenda in 
Georgia.

Main Issue / Challenge

Lack of network capacity








Uncertainty regarding market reform










RE support mechanisms need strengthening









Societal opposition - lack of information and trust

Description

■ Grid limitations for RE integration, lack of reserve capacity.









■ Slow energy market reform, causing uncertainty with inves- tors (policy, social issues, market 
prices).
■ Low electricity prices and missing transparent price mecha- nism in market PPAs. Marginal price 
bidding (consideration of fixed and finance costs).
■ Extra fees (GENEX fee, BM fee, guarantees, imbalances, addi- tional staff costs) are expected 
increase the financial burden that generators would have to pay.
■ Low participation in balancing and ancillary services market (market concentration related to 
major HPPs).


■ Feed-in premium (FiP) offers 1.5 USc/KWh on top of the market price, but there is a limit to 5.5 
USc/KWh, which is quite low considering the high procurement (mostly imports), construction and 
infrastructure installation costs.
■ Furthermore, the support scheme does not apply during the summer months. (Although over 16 HPP 
projects have benefi- ted off this scheme).
■ No incentives for the private sector towards energy saving strategies or approaches.


■ 43 suspended RE projects currently, due to public opposition and prevailing misinformation. 
Resulted in stopping invest- ments of USD 3.8 billion, corresponding to a total capacity of 2,000 
MW and approximately 20,000 jobs.
■ Lack of public awareness about RE and co-benefits, neither about the risks of inaction 
(environmental impacts, on quality of life, including disruption to the ecosystems, landscape 
deterioration, etc.).
■ Disinformation exists for existing RE projects (e.g., percep- tion that HPP construction will 
lead to the flooding and de- struction of karst caves and that a potential dam break will flood 
Kutaisi city and another 17 municipalities of western Georgia).
■ There is a lack of trust and communication between parties (policymakers, the public, industry, 
and investors).
■ Lack of citizen involvement in project development (renewa- ble communities, benefits sharing). 
Misconception in the private sector about investments profitability and the benefits, costs and 
policies that can support them.

Recommendations

■ Flexibility options, including energy storage (such as pum- ped-storage power stations (SPPS) and 
battery storage), dispatchable generation, interconnections, demand-side management, and other 
innovative technologies for better integration of variable RE sources can be promoted.
■ Retrofitting of and constructing power grids play an impor- tant role for better RE integration.
■ Accelerate the roll out of smart meters and smart, digital technologies.
■ Accelerate the adoption of electricity market rules, offer more transparency to market 
participants and investors on the market design, and provide the stability and visibility neces- 
sary to attract investments.
■ Monitor the implementation of the new electricity market and make transparent improvements.
■ The market transitional period impacts the decisions of investors; to this end, there should be a 
transitional action plan that supports investors, as the pricing mechanism becomes clearer.
■ Preserve the Regulator's independence and authority to effectively regulate the market and create 
competitive rules.
■ The FiP scheme could be expanded to apply also to summer months, as hydro and solar plants 
produce more electricity during the summer period. Furthermore, the mechanism should provide some 
guarantee (through a minimum floor price) to the investor at least during the first 10 years.
■ Introduce a Contract for Difference (CfD) mechanism to enable generators to stabilise their 
revenues at a pre-agreed level for the duration of the contract.
■ Develop transitory support schemes (e.g., temporary (3-4 years) tariff guarantee) and plans for 
market stability during transition to the new market model.
■ Develop a strategic long-term communication plan and cam- paigns (on myth-busting, co-benefits, 
etc.) to overcome
the lack of social acceptance - through knowledge exchange, communities of practice, and raise 
awareness among all stakeholder groups. Experts and non-experts should be invol- ved in the 
process.
■ Involve public figures (not necessarily technical) as RE “ambassadors” in the country.
■ It is important to involve citizens, as well as other relevant stakeholders from the planning 
phase of the project develop- ment all the way through its implementation. Investors could carry 
out site visits to communicate with locals before the implementation of the project (potentially 
organise a kick-of- meeting with locals).
■ Introduce legislation for developers to carry out societal engagement prior to project 
implementation. Currently, social impacts are only part of the environmental impacts assess- ment. 
Strategies that developers could consider, depending on the development phase of the project, 
include regular exchange with relevant sector agencies, and environmental associations, assignment 
of a direct and reliable public relations officer, communications agency, etc.
■ Sharing benefits directly with the local population of the impacted area, along with 
communication of the environmental benefits achieved through the project are likely to result in 
lower social opposition.






36 Policy implementation in progress: Renewable Energy Hard Talks

Lack of adequate policy support





















High investment costs




Lack of access to capital
■ Lack of long-term energy strategy. While RE law exists, secon- dary legislation is missing.
■ Lack of subsidies, tax incentives, loan assistance for renewab- les, while fossil fuels are 
highly subsidised.
■ Market entry barriers for solar, wind, and other renewable resources as they need to compete with 
wealthier industries that benefit from existing infrastructure, expertise and policy.
















■ High upfront investment cost for some RE technologies.
■ RE technologies are imported in Georgian market, further increasing the cost.
■ As opposed to investment costs, electricity prices are low.


■ High interest rates with banks.
■ Lack of access to micro-financing, poor business develop- ment skills by RE system 
suppliers/developers.
■ There is a need for a long-term vision and strategic planning for the RE deployment. Set 
ambitious RE targets, consistent with the long-term national energy strategy and action plans to 
increase investors’ confidence on Government’s commit- ment and attract additional capital.
■ Develop strategic documents at regional level for energy planning in a more decentralised way.
■ There is a need for assurances especially during the transition period and coordinated action 
with the Ministry of Finance
to mitigate investors’ concerns by proper planning and a clear vision on the country’s priorities.
■ Encourage RE investments beyond electricity (into renewables- based district heating/cooling; 
clean transport, etc.).
District energy systems could be included in the national energy action plans.
■ Government should end subsidies for fossil fuels and encou- rage replacement of gas boilers with 
more efficient ones. Planning of the heating and cooling sector should consider the availability of 
local resources (such as geothermal, solar, but also waste heat could be considered).
■ The energy policy actions need to be more consistent with the policy objectives (e.g., eliminate 
distortions putting renewables at a disadvantage).
■ Provision of incentives should take into consideration the high prices of the technologies. 
Currently, materials, know- how, and technology are all imported.
■ Consider attaching local-content requirements to RE subsi- dies; however, need to consider how 
this will affect the project costs.
■ Introduce programs to increase awareness and expertise of local financial institutions for RE 
opportunities.
■ Establish micro-financing schemes and increase access to capital.


Project implemen- tation challenges











Lack of local capacity / human resources
■ Reliance on outdated historical data for the planning and financial modelling of RE projects. 
Because of many issues such as climate change, these historical data may not be valid and the 
predictions may change, creating a big gap.
■ Weather forecasts are not so accurate in Georgia, and this creates hurdles in the reliable hourly 
projection of generation. Without reliable forecast, investors are unable to project day/ night 
hourly prices and account for imbalances.
■ Lack of capacity developing full CBA for each project.




■ With the new market reforms, new skill sets will be required. There is currently a lack of skills 
for supporting services (e.g., in forecasting, pricing for the next day), not only technicians and 
engineers, but other specialists, too, such as economists.
■ Lack of spare parts and adequate skills to repair/service the equipment leads to equipment 
failure. This together with low reliability in a technology lowers customer confidence in some RE 
technologies and hinders their adoption.
■ The Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development is under-staffed.
■ Bureaucracy of the state agencies has been reduced and is more accessible now; however, there is 
need for more trans- parency in the project development processes.
■ Accurate resource assessment is necessary. Enhance quality and availability of energy resource 
data and transparency regarding assumptions.
■ Introduce policy to cater for differences in the estimation of investors’ finances at a later 
stage due to unpredictable mete- orological challenges.
■ Proper treatment/allowance should be provided in the for- mulation of rules for Electricity 
Market Reforms to account for challenges in weather forecasting.
■ Intensify capacity building activities through the develop- ment of local education programs and 
incentivise exchange programs for local promising students.
■ Update existing curricula in local universities and develop new programs that introduce students 
to the new technolo- gies and skills required.
■ Encourage the connection/collaboration between the univer- sities and industry and promote an 
industry-oriented focus to research/academic programmes.
■ Provide support to companies that focus on the use of local resources and incentivise local 
production of machinery, spare parts, etc.
■ Capacity building should also take place at a legislative and project level. It is important to 
have competent people in policy and project development.
■ Need for more human resources in the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development.

5.5  RE Hard Talk with the Republic of Serbia: Renewables in Serbia: The Path Ahead, Net Metering 
and Auctions

The UNECE Renewable Energy Hard Talk dedicated to Serbia was held remotely on the 16th and 17th of 
November 2021. The Hard Talk Renewables in Serbia: The Path Ahead, Net Metering and Auctions 
focussed on renewable energy support mechanisms in Serbia with a specific focus on the recent net 
metering scheme and the upcoming renewable energy auctions. The event was made possible through 
close coordination with the Ministry of Mining and Energy of Serbia.

The two-day Hard Talk featured presentations, interventions and discussion from a wide variety of 
Serbian and international en- ergy sector stakeholders. More than 80 participants joined from 
various institutions including: Ministry of Mining and Energy of Serbia, the United Nations, E3 
Analytics, Guidehouse, KfW Bel- grade, AHK Serbia, EBRD, GIZ, Balkan Green Energy News CWP Global, 
CMS Belgrade, MT Komex, Elicio NV and others.

Key issues, challenges, solutions and recommendations regard- ing renewable energy support schemes 
(incl. the net-meter- ing scheme recently developed) as well as renewable energy auctions were 
discussed and refined. The Hard Talk focussed on the following main topics and leading questions:

■ RE Support: How can current support mechanisms for re- newable energy deployment be strengthened 
and impro- ved?
■ RE Support: What is the role of net metering in the deploy- ment of renewable energy in Serbia?
■  RE Auctions: What are the opportunities and challenges for renewable energy auctions in Serbia?
■  RE Auctions: How can international best practice and expe- rience be utilised in the development 
of renewable energy auctions in Serbia?
5.5.1 Country Introduction

Fossil fuels dominate Serbia’s energy mix with 87% of the total primary energy supply (TPES) being 
supplied with fossil fuels in 2017. Only 13% of TPES is covered by renewable energy (RE)
sources, mainly in the electricity sector where RE contribute 37% to the total generation capacity 
(as of 2019). Hydropower makes up 45% of RE capacity and bioenergy 54%. The growth of RE from 2016 
to 2017 has already more than doubled than in the previous five years. Growth in 2016 to 2017 was 
12.2% in comparison to 2012 to 2017 with 5.6%. Through the development of the largest wind park in 
region, it is clear that Serbia also intends to diversify the RE mix. However, the development of 
new RE sources remain in a stagnant state, especially in the PV sector, leading to a miss of RE 
targets. Rising energy demand also outpaced RE expansion, thus further contributing to missed RE 
targets.

To further progress towards the green transition and environ- mental protection, the Law on the Use 
of Renewable Energy Sources was enacted at the beginning of 2021. In addition to ex- isting 
feed-in-tariffs (FiTs), new market premiums, RE auctions and new regulations for prosumers, 
including a net metering scheme aim to drastically increase the uptake of renewables. The new net 
metering scheme was recently launched in Septem- ber 2021, including a 50% rebate on the 
installation costs of new
rooftop PV systems. The first round of auctions in Serbia are to be held in December 2021, followed 
by a three-year schedule, which is to be revealed in February 2022.





















38 Policy implementation in progress: Renewable Energy Hard Talks

5.5.2 Challenges and Recommendations



Main Issue / Challenge

Strategic planning of renewable energy deploy- ment and alignment with climate targets








Strengthening support mechanisms for renewable energy














Lack of qualified personnel for the renewable energy industry

Description

Planning and economic resource analysis for solar and wind is lacking. This hinders policy 
development and the setting of reali- stic targets, least-cost power system planning, and the 
ability to develop and implement appropriate support mechanisms.









Fiscal incentives and policies such as feed-in-tariffs (FiT) or pre- miums (FiP) and tax reductions 
comprise the main supporting mechanisms to attract investments in renewables. The new net metering 
scheme was recently launched in September 2021, including a 50% rebate on the installation costs of 
new rooftop PV systems up to 6kW in a first round offer. Given the relative immaturity of the 
market and recent adoption of said measu- res, increased adoption requires a change of mindset from 
local experts and industry. To aid adoption, current support mecha- nisms and associated processes 
could be revised and improved.









Skilled workers will be required throughout the emerging renewable energy industry in Serbia. This 
includes technicians and engineers but also managers and economists. Dedicated renewable energy 
training and education at vocational, tertiary and technical levels is lacking. Such investment and 
nurturing of human resources and expertise are required to maximise and ensure the development of 
local economies.

Recommendations

■ A comprehensive plan that aggregates energy sector data such as renewable energy zoning, energy 
resource potentials and historical statistical trends, together with qualitative and quantitative 
information, into a clearly formulated and evidence-based development pathway will allow for sound 
decision-making and sector development. Energy Action Plans should also be developed at a municipal 
level.
■ RE zones should be developed in accordance with analysis of resource potential, grid access and 
ability to receive renewa- ble inflows, geographic and environmental aspects, proximity to demand, 
etc.
■ The national integrated energy and climate plan (NECP) should be finalised as soon as possible.
■ Administrative simplification for approval and licensing of renewable energy projects is 
required.
• Create a “One-stop-shop” for renewable energy project approval and licensing to enable 
streamlined deployment of projects.
■ Advanced Net-Metering schemes could be explored and prepared for implementation, including 
third-party ownership and financing, rooftop leases and PPAs (power purchase agreements) and 
‘virtual net metering’ for energy communities.
■ Lack of clear procedure for remuneration of surplus energy reduces bankability of prosumer 
projects.
• Energy pay factoring in the average market price of that year could be a workable solution.
■ Currently rolled out solar PV equipment is not always future- proof.
• Inverter standards and requirements for smart equipment should be introduced from an early time 
to ensure equip- ment is compatible with future technologies.
■ A comprehensive power system plan should be established to match future grid reinforcements and 
extensions with the planned deployment of RE capacities in order to ensure more efficient system 
integration.
■ Market-based support mechanisms coupled to the day-ahead market price should be introduced to 
increase market inte- gration:
• Variable premiums (one-way or two-way contract for diffe- rence (CfD) provide higher planning 
certainty for investors and offer a lower risk premium than fixed premium.
• Fixed premiums could also be considered and are less complex and easier to understand and 
implement early on. There is however exposure to long-term electricity price volatility.
■ A fixed premium could be initially introduced and transition to a variable/sliding premium as the 
wholesale market deve- lops and capacities increase.














39 Policy implementation in progress: Renewable Energy Hard Talks

Balancing responsibility





Cost competitiveness of projects with older or outdated technology
The responsibility for system balancing, including balancing costs as a result of increasingly 
intermittent generation from higher shares of renewable energy and subsequent deviations in planned 
from actual production volumes remains unclear and the respective bylaws are yet to be finalised.



Due to the lengthy process from announcement of auction, bids, awarding of bids and finally project 
realisation, projects permit- ted with old technology, in particular older wind turbine models, may 
have difficulty competing with the levelised cost of electricy (LCoE) of new projects in 
development.
■ A liquid intra-day market is a precondition for full balancing responsibility however an 
intermediate solution of ‘par- tial responsibility’ through a cap or fixed imbalance price/ 
penalty-free production deviation could be considered.
■ The decree regulating balancing responsibility for renewable energy producers should be finalised 
and published as soon as possible.
■ In the case of wind projects, the turbine selection should be moved to a later stage in the 
planning/permitting process
to allow up-to-date equipment to be deployed at the time of construction. This will ensure that the 
most competitive technology options can be considered throughout implemen- tation from the initial 
winning of the auction, approval and awarding of capacity right up until construction.



5.6  RE Hard Talk with the Republic of Moldova: Renewables, Resilience and Flexibility Options in 
the Republic of Moldova

The UNECE Renewable Energy Hard Talk with the Republic of Moldova took place in Chisinau, Moldova 
on June 14, 2022. The exclusive event dealt with the integration of renewable energy with a focus 
on resilience and flexibility options in the energy system of the Republic of Moldova.

The event was organized by the UNECE project team together with the host- and partner organisation 
the Ministry of Infrastruc- ture and Regional Development of the Republic of Moldova.

More than 50 participants joined the Hard Talk, which featured presentations, interventions and 
discussion from selected Mol- davian and international energy sector stakeholders, including: the 
Ministry of Infrastructure and Regional Development of the Republic of Moldova, the National Energy 
Regulatory Agency, Moldelectrica, CET Nord, Premier Energy Moldova, RED Nord, the Energy Community 
Moldova, World Bank, USAID, European Business Association, Energy Efficiency Agency, 
Termoelectrica, American Chamber of Commerce Moldova, and others.

Key issues, challenges, solutions and recommendations regard- ing the successful expansion and 
integration of renewables, including resilience and flexibility options were discussed. The main 
topics and leading questions addressed in the Hard Talk with the Republic of Moldova were:

■ What flexibility options are available to increase system security and resiliency in Moldova?
■ What actions need to be taken in the short to medium term to sufficiently plan for greater shares 
of variable renewable energy?
5.6.1 Country Introduction

The energy system of the republic of Moldova features low levels of indigenous, natural resources 
and production and thus has a heavy reliance on energy imports; more than 70% of primary energy 
supply, including natural gas, petroleum and electricity
is imported, mainly from the Russian Federation via Ukraine. The share of electricity in final 
energy consumption is also low at approximately 15% as of 2019, illustrating the low level of 
electri- fication and heavy reliance on gas imports and generation.
Electricity is predominantly generated by the large gas-fired power plant in the breakaway region 
of Transnistria or imported from the Ukraine. Domestic electricity production includes the Cotesti 
hydro power plant, several large cogeneration plants in Chisinau and Balti and a negligible number 
of small renewable energy systems.

Albeit largely untapped, the Republic of Moldova features great potential for renewable energy, 
including wind, solar and bioen- ergy resources. In addition to the clear benefit of increased 
energy security and diversification of supply, the expansion of renewable energy sources offers a 
range of benefits including increased employment and improved health, and a reduction of emissions 
and associated negative climate impacts from fossil fuel use.

Given the recent global developments, it is clear that greater energy independence and 
diversification of supply, especially in the immediate region, should be of primary concern for the 
Republic of Moldova and its neighbours.

To enable the successful integration of renewable energy sources, both variable and dispatchable, a 
reliable energy system and power network is essential. The power network of the Republic of Moldova 
is however outdated, demand fluctuates greatly and the interconnector capacity is low. The 
potential for grid stabilization measures made available through the ENTSO-E synchronization in 
March 2022 are therefore severely inhibited and cannot be leveraged. In addition to current issues, 
energy system stakehold- ers are concerned that the increase of variable energy resources such as 
wind and solar will exacerbate current grid operation issues and lead to additional balancing 
problems and costs.


40 Policy implementation in progress: Renewable Energy Hard Talks

5.6.2 Challenges and Recommendations



Main Issue / Challenge

Increasing and ensuring enough flexibility sources to account for increased shares of variable 
renewables























Consider the role that bioenergy can have in contributing to system flexibility and energy 
independence









Network losses

Description

Due to a lack of domestic resources and generation assets, the energy system of the Republic of 
Moldova lacks system flexibility options and relies almost exclusively on Ukraine for system ba- 
lancing. As the share or variable renewable energy sources incre- ases, so too will the need to 
flexibility options.

























In addition to providing renewable energy for heating and elec- tricity, bioenergy can provide 
short-term flexibility to help stabi- lize the electricity grid with both positive and negative 
ancillary services and provide long-term flexibility through storage and transportation of 
biomass-based energy. The current promotion and support of bioenergy projects, in particular biogas 
plants,
is insufficient to incentivize further investment and market de- velopment.








The majority of RES in the Republic of Moldova are connected to the distribution network. 
Long-distance transport of electrical energy produced by renewable energy systems through distribu- 
tion networks of medium voltage generate significant energy losses.

Recommendations

■ A comprehensive power system plan should be finalised as soon as possible and align future grid 
reinforcements and extensions with the planned deployment of renewable ener- gy capacities in order 
to ensure efficient system integration.
■ Development of standards and guidelines for relevant actors: generators and plant operations, 
network operators, etc.
■ Implementation of intelligent equipment and systems for effective management of renewable energy 
systems.
■ Establishment and maintenance of a database of renewable energy systems for analysis, planning 
and forecasting.
■ The responsibility for system balancing, including balancing costs as a result of increasingly 
intermittent generation from higher shares of renewable energy and subsequent devia- tions in 
planned from actual production volumes remains un- clear and the respective bylaws are yet to be 
finalised. Clear rules and responsibility for balancing need to be finalised and applied as soon as 
possible.
■ Stakeholder training should be developed and implemen- ted, including: network codes (ENTSO-E), 
system operator requirements, market rules, best practices, technical solu- tions, etc.
■ As a short-term measure, battery energy storage systems (BESS) could be integrated to provide 
frequency control servi- ces and allow for accurate real-time balancing.
■ In the medium to long-term further increase of storage, eit- her BESS or possibly pumped-storage 
hydro power plants could enable higher shares of renewable energy system (RES) integration and 
mitigate spilled energy and the need for cur- tailment.
■ The role of Bioenergy in contributing to system flexibility and integration of other RES should 
be further explored and ex- ploited.
■ A bioenergy strategy that promotes the use of biomass, further develops biomass trade and 
communication across the relevant supply chains and increases the role of bioenergy in the energy 
sector should be developed.
• This strategy should build upon the work in biomass pre- viously undertaken by UNDP and partners 
from 2011-2018 and ensure sustainable development of bioenergy resour- ces taking into account the 
low level of forestation in the country.
■ Promotion of Bioenergy technologies, including biogas plants should consider additional benefits 
such as flexible ancillary services (flexibility premiums) to ensure sufficient incentives for 
investments and market development.
■ Sophisticated modeling and tracking tools should be develo- ped and optimised, such as 
interactive maps with load curve graphs for various geographical areas.
■ RES could be paired with BESS to enable greater flexibility and optimal dispatch.

Maintenance of renewable energy systems and system equipment










Network access for renewable energy systems






Review methodo- logy for setting and communicating tariffs for RES









Increasing attrac- tiveness for renewable energy investments and project development
Given the immaturity of the renewable energy sector, processes, supply chains and standards are not 
yet sufficiently established for the proper operation, servicing and maintenance of rene- wable 
energy systems and equipment, thus creating even more uncertainty for successful network 
integration and operation.










The number of valid requests for RES connection to the electrici- ty network are far greater than 
those that are actually issued and connected despite capacities being available. Quotas are often 
reserved but not actually used.





Previously set tariffs have been insufficient in driving invest- ments and the methodology by which 
they were determined have been criticised, as well as how relevant stakeholders were involved and 
informed.









The current regulation and secondary legislation on the promo- tion of RES is yet to successfully 
create an attractive regulatory framework and market for private investments.
■ Complete technical regulatory framework with minimum requirements for operation of electrical 
equipment and rene- wable energy systems.
■ Complete regulation on maintenance procedures. Mainte- nance of installations should be carried 
out by properly certi- fied, specialised personnel.
■ Periodic assessment of RES systems, including technical and performance tests and standards.
■ Scheduled maintenance should be planned and coordinated between relevant parties.
■ Development of interaction agreements between stakehol- ders and involved parties: OEM suppliers, 
operators, service providers, etc.
■ Remove barriers for market participants - connection re- quests should be based on liability and 
guarantees.
■ Identify solutions that would allow the maximum quotas for renewable capacity approved by the 
Government to be real- located to other technologies if quotas are not met.
■ Increase the maximum capacity for Net Metering – the process to amend the capacity limit should 
be initiated and completed as soon as possible.
■ The method for calculating tariffs and other mechanisms should be made transparent and all 
relevant actors should be consulted.
■ When determining tariffs for different RES, additional factors and aspects should be considered 
by the regulator when cal- culating and adjusting tariffs. For example, additional bene- fits 
beyond energy such as flexibility, security of supply, foste- ring the establishment of local 
industry, and other intangible benefits should be considered.
■ Tariffs should be reviewed to allow for adjustments or other mechanisms to better account for 
inflation, exchange rate movements, other effects such as lack of required resources,
e.g. biomass resources.

■ Dedicated policies to increase investor interest should be ex- plored and implemented (e.g. 
reduced import duties for RES).
■ A bankable Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) should be de- veloped, including guarantees and 
predictability for involved stakeholders, such as: offtake obligation, balancing obliga- tions and 
costs, clear rules on liability for non-compliance, instruments to ensure payment security, rules 
on the transfer of obligations in the event of a new central supplier, and spe- cified duration 
terms, amongst others.
■ Rules for the designation of long-term central supplier should be established.
■ Protection against changes in the law after the implementati- on of support schemes is required.
■ Clear and transparent rules for renewable energy auctions, including transparent auction design 
and implementation with the involvement of the energy community should be prioritised.
■ Focus state support programs to areas of activity with poten- tial to produce raw material 
(biomass) for non-variable, flexi- ble technologies, such as biogas CHP plants.
■ Optimisation of net metering mechanism (change of calcula- tion period, shift to net billing).
■ Increase the maximum capacity for Net Metering – the pro- cess to amend the capacity limit should 
be initiated and com- pleted as soon as possible.






42 Policy implementation in progress: Renewable Energy Hard Talks

Difficulties in finding funding sources and financial services



Lack of qualified energy sector experts and specialists








Bureaucratic hurdles and misalignment between relevant authorities

Strategic planning of renewable energy deploy- ment and alignment with climate targets
The financial and banking sector in the Republic of Moldova is comparatively small and has less 
experience and limited expertise with capital-intensive renewable energy projects. The relative 
immaturity and limited understanding results and higher per- ceived risk associated with renewable 
energy projects, ultimately leading to higher financing costs and unattractive lending 
arrangements.

There is a lack of qualified specialists on the labor market. Skilled workers will be required 
throughout the emerging rene- wable energy industry in the Republic of Moldova. This includes 
technicians and engineers but also managers and economists. Dedicated renewable energy training and 
education at vocatio- nal, tertiary and technical levels is lacking. Such investment and nurturing 
of human resources and expertise are required to maximise and ensure the development of local 
economies.





Requirements to obtain building permits and other required project documents are far too onerous, 
require coordination with and approval by multiple bodies resulting in lengthy pro- ject 
development timelines, and thus, need to be streamlined.


Planning and economic resource analysis for solar and wind is lacking. This hinders policy 
development and the setting of reali- stic targets, least-cost power system planning, and the 
ability to develop and implement appropriate support mechanisms.
■ Enhance and standardize required finance and project docu- ment to promote clarity, understanding 
and transparency.
■ Diversify funding programs for RES projects and facilitating access to the financial market.
■ Improve bankability of projects including the establishment of a bankable PPA.
■ Capacity building: investors, design engineers, installers, other supporting staff.
■ Update existing curricula in local universities and develop new programs that introduce students 
to the new technolo- gies and skills required.
■ Encourage the connection/collaboration between the univer- sities and industry and promote an 
industry-oriented focus to research/academic programs.
■ The introduction of renewable energy training programs and a focus on specific areas such as PV 
should be prioritised in order to realise benefits as soon as possible.
■ Establish a central body or authority ‘one-stop-shop’ to stream- line the process for approval 
and licensing of RES project development.
■ Optimise and standardise project documentation to promote clarity, understanding and 
transparency.
■ A comprehensive plan that aggregates energy sector data such as renewable energy zoning, energy 
resource potentials and historical statistical trends, together with qualitative and quantitative 
information, into a clearly formulated and evidence-based development pathway will allow for sound 
decision-making and sector development. Energy Action Plans should also be developed at a municipal 
level.
■ RE zones should be developed in accordance with analysis of resource potential, grid access and 
ability to receive renewable inflows, geographic and environmental aspects, proximity to demand, 
etc.

06 Conclusion




This report provides an insight into the status quo of renewable energy deployment and policymaking 
in the UNECE region. As the analysis has shown, several key motivations drive the uptake of 
renewable energy: In addition to mitigation of climate change and regional pollution and the 
reconstruction of future-proof economies after the Covid-19 pandemic, improvements in the security 
and affordability of energy supply and energy independ- ence are high on the political agenda in 
many member states.
Countries throughout the region are at very different stages of renewable energy uptake and highly 
diverse in terms of their approaches to renewable energy deployment. The analysis of the share of 
renewables in TFEC conducted for this report shed light on the status of renewable energy 
deployment in the UNECE sub-regions: Since the start of the new millennium, the use of renewable 
energy grew the steadiest in Western and Central Europe. North America and Eastern Europe had 
slower, but also steady growth. In Southeast Europe renewable energy use in contrast, was subject 
to more fluctuations but increased most dynamically overall. In Central Asia, the Caucasus and the 
Russian Federation, the share of renewables in TFEC stagnated or even declined in the years leading 
up to 2019.

Bioenergy and hydropower remain the dominant sources of renewable energy in the UNECE region. 
However, both show either slower growth (bioenergy) or stagnation (hydropower) in their 
contribution to the energy mix for the region. Wind energy and solar energy, on the other hand, 
have significantly gained im- portance for the energy mix of various states. In fact, renewable 
energy use in the power sector, mainly from wind and solar, has developed more dynamically than any 
other source of energy
in recent years. Particularly Western and Central Europe, North America and Southeast Europe have 
increased their use of renewable electricity from wind and PV power plants. Despite the enormous 
potential and the importance of the heating sector as the main energy application in the region, 
renewable energy is not as widely adopted in the heating sector as in the power sector.

The uptake of renewable energy, including both renewable electricity and renewable heating 
solutions, face similar, over- arching barriers and challenges: First, a vision, a clear political 
commitment and a roadmap outlying the pathway to a new energy system are prerequisites for 
successful and sustainable deploy- ment of renewable energy. Many countries in the UNECE region 
have not yet produced or adopted a comprehensive renewable energy strategy. This hampers the 
confidence of potential investors and energy sector stakeholders, neglects essential, overarching 
system planning and ultimately hinders energy system development. Second, the economic viability of 
renewable
energy projects, foremost in the power sector, has improved vast- ly over the last decade but has 
not yet been effectively realised throughout the UNECE region. Despite the competitiveness of 
renewables, renewable energy projects are not yet economically attractive in all countries in the 
UNECE region. In particular, market-distorting subsidies, misaligned taxes and levies as well as 
instable revenue flows hamper the economic viability of renew- able energy generators. Third, a 
lack of infrastructural flexibility has been found to be a prevalent barrier for successful 
integration of intermittent renewable energy. Fourth, a lack of awareness
of the benefits of renewable energy and a lack of energy sector expertise and capacity is still far 
spread across the UNECE region.

As the analysis in this report has shown, nearly all UNECE member states introduced legislation to 
tackle the main barriers of renewable expansion. National deployment targets and financial 
incentives are among the most widely used measures to provide the sector with an overarching energy 
sector strategy and address a lack of economic viability. Renewable heat is promoted in fewer 
member states than renewable power generation, revealing that governments currently mainly focus on 
the power sector for renewable energy deployment.

Given the variety in renewable energy deployment status and approaches to policymaking, there is 
great potential for
knowledge transfer and mutual learning among UNECE member states. The four Hard Talks held in the 
framework of the UNECE Re-Uptake project with Albania, Georgia, Serbia and the Republic of Moldova 
facilitated such regional exchange and sharing of international best practice and experience. 
Although very diverse in terms of energy supply and demand, common themes and challenges were 
identified in each of the Hard Talks, including:
a lack of energy system planning, immature or inadequate market structures and a lack of awareness 
and expertise of renewable energy.

All in all, this report as well as the conducted Hard Talks aid current and future development on 
the uptake of renewable energy by presenting the status of renewable energy uptake in the region – 
never have the conditions been more favourable for realising the potential of renewable energy in 
reducing emissions and achieving climate neutral energy supply and ensuring affordable and secure 
energy provision throughout the UNECE region.
