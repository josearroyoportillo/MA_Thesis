1. Executive summary
Green hydrogen is gaining importance as an energy carrier, an enabler of system integration, as 
well as a feedstock (substitution) for several industrial processes. It will be an important 
building block for the transition process to a decarbonised energy system. Besides the production 
of renewable electricity, the production of green hydrogen1 from offshore wind in the North Sea is 
promising given its relatively shallow sea depth and favourable wind speeds. This report presents a 
feasibility study assessing the potential and boundary conditions for green hydrogen pro- duction 
in the Dutch and German offshore and coastal regions of the North Sea from electricity produced 
from offshore wind and for delivering hydrogen to demand centres in the Netherlands and North 
Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) from 2025 to 2050. In this context, exploratory scenarios have been 
developed that explore more than just current energy policy goals2 and allow us to provide first 
insights into how a transnational hydrogen economy could look in 2050.

Two key statements were derived from the analysis:
OPPORTUNITY: Cooperation between the Netherlands and Germany in developing a common hydrogen market 
and infrastructure boosts opportunities for realising a decarbonised regional economy.
CALL FOR ACTION: Trigger joint initiatives to establish a common market, remove regulatory 
barriers, de- velop a common vision for hydrogen infrastructure, foster cross border collaboration 
on industrial trans- formation, establish joint R&D and innovation initiatives and establish 
binational projects with net benefits to the Dutch and German energy systems.

The results of the study are summarized below and ultimately provide five key findings and 
recommendations.

1.1.  Results of the feasibility study

How is the existing and future hydrogen demand expected to develop in the Netherlands and North 
Rheine- Westphalia?

Versatile transportation and industrial applications of hydrogen are to be considered on the demand 
side. There is a high technology readiness for most hydrogen applications in industry with 
transportation application close behind. In industry, utilisation of green hydrogen is possible as 
an alternative to grey hydrogen and in processes that now use fossil fuels. The most promising 
industry sectors for green hydrogen usage are those that already use hydrogen as a raw material or 
fuel today, such as basic chemical industries for ammonia and methanol synthesis, naphtha 
production in refineries, as well as steel, cement and glass production. In the transportation 
sector, hy- drogen can be used in various types of fuel cell electric vehicles (bus, train, 
heavy-duty vehicles and passenger


1 Green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis of water, using only electricity from renewable 
sources. Regardless of the electrolysis technology selected, the production of hydrogen is 
CO2-free, as 100 percent of the electricity used comes from renewable sources, which are CO2-free 
(description from the German National Hydrogen strategy).

cars). With respect to demand size, the starting point for the assessment of future demand is the 
current demand for grey hydrogen.

According to analysed scenarios current industrial applications in the petrochemical and chemical 
industry in North Rhine-Westphalia and the Netherlands have a hydrogen demand of 17 TWh and 41 TWh 
per year, respec- tively, which is substantial. The potential future hydrogen market is modelled 
under the assumption of a cost- optimal energy system for achieving a greenhouse gas reduction 
target of -95% by 2050. The demand scenario is based on the recent hydrogen roadmap of North 
Rhine-Westphalia and was adapted to the Dutch industrial areas. Results show that during the 
initial phase of the scenario, up to 2030, hydrogen demand is primarily governed by commercial 
transport applications such as trains, buses, light-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles, as well as by 
substi- tution of the current hydrogen demand in the chemical and petrochemical industry. Later, 
between 2030 and 2040, passenger cars and the steel and synthetic fuel sectors become increasingly 
important. From 2035, the largest long-term impact on demand comes from production of synthetic 
kerosene, synthetic diesel and synthetic naph- tha, under the assumption of decarbonisation of the 
refinery sector via green hydrogen utilisation. Finally, be- tween 2040 and 2050, a more extensive 
hydrogen adoption for process heat in high-temperature furnaces and the cement industry is 
anticipated. By 2050, demand in NRW approaches 162 TWh and in the Netherlands 239 TWh in terms of 
the above-mentioned sectors. In the considered scenario, a common market involving both NRW and the 
Netherlands more than doubles the potential hydrogen demand of each region, thus increasing the 
chances for a large-scale market for green hydrogen.

What are the potentials for green hydrogen production from offshore wind in the Dutch and German 
North Sea?

For this study, it was assumed that green hydrogen is produced using electrolysis of fresh or 
desalinated sea water, powered by renewable electricity from offshore wind sources in the North 
Sea. To assess the potential yield of hydrogen production at the Dutch and German North Sea, 
onshore and offshore production concepts are investi- gated in combination with several operational 
settings of electrolysis facilities. A simplified conceptual configura- tion of hydrogen delivery 
to a potential hydrogen backbone pipeline is presumed, with three possible coastal feed- in points, 
two in the Netherlands (Groningen and Rotterdam) and one in Germany (Emden). Taking into account 
national offshore wind targets until 2040, the EU Offshore Renewable Energy Strategy and all 
potentially available areas for the years beyond, a roadmap for the development of offshore wind 
capacities in the North Sea is devel- oped for the reference years (2025 to 2050). The determined 
installed capacity of offshore wind parks in the exclu- sive economic zones in the Dutch and German 
North Sea by 2050 is ca. 68 GW for the Netherlands and ca. 53 GW for Germany. As far as technically 
and economically feasible, the available capacities should be used primarily for renewable 
electricity generation. Based on determined offshore wind capacities, the national offshore wind 
tar- gets and ambitions for future electrolysis capacity, an electrolysis development roadmap for 
the North Sea areas is developed. In this respect, a total of five scenarios for the hydrogen 
production with offshore wind combined with onshore and offshore electrolysis are modelled. The aim 
is to analyse different conceptual approaches and their implications on scale, costs and timing of 
hydrogen production from offshore sources. In this respect, the scenarios should be interpreted as 
exploratory scenarios for hydrogen production from offshore wind and not as

optimal energy production scenarios or realistic forecasts. In order to be able to carry out the 
evaluation of the green hydrogen supply scenarios, some essential simplifications were necessary. 
When interpreting the results the limits resulting from the assumptions made must be taken into 
account. First of all, a complete utilisation of the offshore wind potentials for electricity 
production in each reference year was assumed to be coupled with hydro- gen production in the 
analysed scenarios. Therefore, the derived results on technical and economic data may differ 
project-specifically (e.g. for certain areas). Only offshore wind was considered as an electricity 
source. Other sources such as grid electricity, onshore wind or solar energy, could positively 
influence hydrogen production per- formance and economics. Furthermore, offshore grid connection 
points further inland, as described in the German Network Development Plan, were not considered in 
the analysis. Technological innovations in the early stages of development such as floating wind 
turbines, hybrid projects, energy islands, etc. could bring additional benefits in the medium to 
long term, but were not considered in this phase of the analysis. Finally, only the pipeline 
transport of hydrogen from the offshore plants and no alternatives, such as in-land shipping 
transport, were con- sidered.

Hydrogen production quantities and scale-up pathways vary substantially between the analysed 
scenarios due to different operational strategies for the electrolysers. However, in all scenarios, 
significant production begins from 2035 if 10–50% of electricity from offshore-wind is converted to 
hydrogen. By 2050, annual hydrogen production from offshore wind could reach 54–139 TWh for the 
Netherlands and 37–100 TWh for Germany.

The expected production costs of hydrogen including associated costs of transporting electricity or 
hydrogen to the coastal feed-in points are subject to high uncertainty. This makes it very 
difficult to provide accurate cost esti- mates of hydrogen production from offshore wind until 
2050. Nevertheless, the cost of green hydrogen production is expected to follow a downward trend. 
It is probable that it will be competitive with domestic and imported blue hydrogen. These market 
trends highly depend on prevailing and future commodity prices and diverse regulating mechanisms. 
Under conservative assumptions we see the costs of green hydrogen supply converge at ca. 4 and 5 
EUR/kg by 2040.

How could the demand and supply centres be connected by the repurposed transport network and 
storages in the Netherlands and Germany and how to match hydrogen supply and demand?
Reliance on the existing natural gas transmission network for future hydrogen transport is 
anticipated in both the German and Dutch hydrogen strategies. Furthermore, in both countries, gas 
transmission operators have pub- lished their visions for a national hydrogen backbone. The Dutch 
ministry of Economic Affairs has published the HyWay 27 study for the realisation of a national 
hydrogen backbone. €750 million has been reserved for this plan. These visions and plans were used 
as an input for analyses of the transnational hydrogen infrastructure in this study.
The underlying hydrogen backbone consists predominantly of more than 5,000 km repurposed gas 
pipelines and allows the connection of demand centres with three coastal feed-in supply points. 
Also, it connects four storage sites with underground salt caverns in both countries – one in the 
Netherlands and three in Germany, offering flexibility and security of supply. Finally, it connects 
the hydrogen transport network to two import locations – one in the port of Rotterdam and one 
import hub in northwest of Germany (Wilhelmshaven, for example). A network

model analysis was performed for the demand scenario and for two supply scenarios. Mismatch in 
hourly demand and supply quantities are covered by storage and import of hydrogen. The results show 
that green hydrogen pro- duced from offshore wind is not sufficient to meet hydrogen demand in the 
Netherlands and North Rhine-West- phalia and that additional sources are needed from the start. 
Bottlenecks in hydrogen pipeline infrastructure may develop near coastal feed-in points and import 
connections from 2035 onwards, but can be alleviated by diversi- fying import via other harbours 
such as Wilhelmshaven in Germany and by additional network reinforcements. Joint grid development 
between the Netherlands and Germany is required, both for the timely repurposing of the existing 
gas grid and gas storages for the use with hydrogen as well as for the development of new hydrogen 
pipe- lines.

What are the pathways and obstacles towards a potential transnational hydrogen market?
Future business models for the realisation of a green hydrogen market need the right framework 
conditions. An overview of the respective value chains shows gaps to be bridged with respect to 
market functions, energy infra- structure, stakeholder roles and market designs. On the other hand, 
value chains can evolve from the established and functioning offshore wind and gas markets and from 
existing industry demand.
For the assumptions in this study, the prices for green hydrogen converge at 4–5 EUR/kg by 2040. 
For blue hydrogen we see costs modelled between 2–3 EUR/kg by 2035 although estimates highly depend 
on the prevailing and future commodity prices for natural gas and CO2, being influenced by diverse 
regulating mechanisms. This suggests the need for support mechanisms for green hydrogen to become 
and remain competitive and bring down costs further. An enabling market design and regulatory 
framework is needed to establish certification of green hydrogen, to allow large-scale onshore and 
offshore integration of power-to-gas technology and to facilitate integrated grid planning for both 
natural gas and hydrogen. This should also include close cross-border coordination and cooper- 
ation.

1.2.  Key findings
Large-scale, cross-border hydrogen value chains can contribute to the evolution of renewable 
electricity and nat- ural gas systems into an integrated and decarbonised energy system. EU, 
national and regional policies have set ambitious offshore wind and electrolyser capacity targets. 
The value chains examined in the study fit well within this framework. Cooperation between the 
Netherlands and Germany in developing a common hydrogen market and infrastructure can foster the 
opportunities for realising a decarbonised economy. Realizing these opportuni- ties will require 
coordinated and effective actions that remove remaining barriers and overcome uncertainties. The 
following key findings can be derived from the results of the study, which call for action by all 
stakeholders.
1. Dutch-German cooperation will be beneficial to build up and connect the markets for hydrogen in 
NRW and the Netherlands.
▪  A common market for both NRW and the Netherlands would more than double the potential demand for 
hydrogen in this area.
▪  Cooperation enables the use of synergies, e.g. higher market volume for services and better 
utilisation of infrastructure, reduces the risk of stranded assets and increases security of supply 
in this region.


8 / 146

▪  Integrated development could achieve better scaling and utilisation of hydrogen 
infrastructure.

2. The transformation of the petrochemical and chemical industry structures in the cross border 
region will drive the demand for hydrogen.
▪  Initial demand for hydrogen in NRW and the Netherlands is expected to be driven primarily by 
substitution of current hydrogen consumption in the chemical and petrochemical industries, as well 
as commercial transport applications such as buses, trucks, trains and cars.
▪  In the chemical and petrochemical industry, there are a variety of applications for the use of 
green hydro- gen, e.g. for methanol and ammonia production or for decarbonisation of fuel refining.

3.  Coastal and offshore hydrogen production can contribute to the utilisation of the North Sea 
wind en- ergy potential and to domestic hydrogen supply.
▪  The cost for onshore and offshore green hydrogen production in Germany and Netherlands is not 
yet com- petitive, but projections clearly show downward trends. Green hydrogen production from 
offshore wind is expected to become competitive with domestic and imported blue hydrogen.
▪  Hydrogen production onshore and offshore from offshore wind sources is likely to accommodate 
more wind energy in the system as it helps support decarbonisation strategies for several 
hard-to-abate sectors at the lowest system cost.
▪  Hydrogen production from North Sea offshore wind needs to be assessed in terms of value and cost 
in relation to other hydrogen sources, sectoral decarbonisation strategies and strategic advantages 
such as domestic production, security of supply and public acceptance.
▪  Both onshore as offshore production concepts need to be further explored regarding the location 
and optimal operation of the electrolysis and the balance between electricity and hydrogen feed in 
the energy system.

4. To meet future hydrogen demand in the Netherlands and NRW, other sources beyond green hydrogen 
produced from offshore wind in the North Sea are needed in any case.
▪  Green hydrogen produced from offshore wind in the North Sea has vast production potential, but 
it is still insufficient for meeting the projected hydrogen demand. This deficit in hydrogen 
production capacity grows exponentially from 2025 to 2050.
▪  Other sources of hydrogen in addition to green hydrogen produced from offshore wind will be 
needed in the future. These other sources can include domestic production of green hydrogen from 
solar and do- mestic and imported blue hydrogen.

5.  Repurposing of parts of the existing gas infrastructure in the Netherlands and Germany yields 
suffi- cient transport and storage capacity for hydrogen by 2030.
▪  Repurposing of parts of the existing gas infrastructure for hydrogen transport in the 
Netherlands and Ger- many yields sufficient transport capacity by 2030. After 2030, bottlenecks 
could occur in certain regions.

▪  The development of hydrogen storage in existing and new salt caverns in both the Netherlands and 
Ger- many will be a useful and necessary balancing asset for offering flexibility to the energy 
system. One to five caverns will be needed in 2030, with this number increasing to 49 to 57 caverns 
by 2050. These esti- mates only consider storage capacity needed to balance supply and demand 
fluctuations for a year with normal weather. Factoring in strategic reserves and yearly variations 
in supply and demand would likely increase the storage need.
▪  Gas storage sites currently using caverns for gas storage offer a large technical potential for 
hydrogen storage. However, in order to support new hydrogen infrastructure, new caverns will likely 
be needed dur- ing transition phase where both natural gas and hydrogen storage capacity will be 
necessary.
▪  A coupled binational approach brings synergies and efficiency in terms of capacity and 
utilisation of stor- age and pipelines, for example. To leverage synergies a joint vision for a 
hydrogen infrastructure between the Netherlands and Germany is required. Grid repurposing and 
renewing takes multiple years from plan- ning to executing, highlighting the need for urgent 
coordinated NL-DE action to meet 2025 and 2030 goals.


1.3.  Recommendations
This feasibility study was prepared in the context of the Dutch-German Green Hydrogen Cooperation 
with the aim to put Germany and the Netherlands on the forefront of global green hydrogen 
deployment in an energy system relevant scale. It makes an important contribution to current 
discussions and issues in the context of decarbonis- ing industry with hydrogen and the potential 
use of offshore wind for hydrogen production. The large number of projects currently announced 
shows that the topic is important to stakeholders and politicians alike. It is im- portant to use 
the current momentum and strengthen the cooperation between the two countries in order to clar- ify 
open issues and enable the development and implementation of successful projects. The following 
recommen- dations are intended to facilitate this process.
1. Dutch-German Green Hydrogen Cooperation
First of all, the Netherlands and Germany should further investigate potentials and instruments for 
cooperation with the aim of developing the hydrogen economy in the cross-border region in a 
coordinated manner and devel- oping it with the close involvement of North Rhine Westphalia and 
Lower Saxony and relevant stakeholders (e.g. authorities, energy agencies, project coordinators). 
It is reasonable to establish a continuous exchange of experience on open questions in the context 
of hydrogen production, transport and use, such as power supply, grid connection or quality 
standards, and on framework conditions at national and European level. Furthermore, the cooperation 
between the Netherlands and Germany should be used and communicated as a lighthouse project to make 
the development of transnational hydrogen value chains visible in Europe.









10 / 146
29.03.2022









2. Grid, network and storage infrastructure
To support the development of grids, networks and storage facilities, the Dutch and German grid 
operators for electricity and gas should be invited to identify potentials and projects for 
cooperation for the region on grid in- frastructure and hydrogen storage that complements and 
deepens the national and European planning and de- rives a joint step-by-step approach.
3. Hydrogen market and trade
The transnational market and hydrogen trading should be supported by exchanging market information 
(e.g. ex- pected demand over time) and developing strategic measures regarding the import and 
integration of hydrogen from international markets. In the long run, the development of a 
Dutch-German hydrogen market hub matching system should be developed and supported, connecting 
players from demand and supply side.
4. Industrial transformation
The exchange with industry partners should be continued, and the governments should establish and 
support transnational networks and working groups of industrial enterprises with high 
transformation pressure to accom- pany change in the industrial value chain. The petrochemical and 
chemical industry in the considered region is already strongly linked. Close cooperation already 
exists through the “Trilateral strategy for the chemical industry” and other cross-border 
collaborations [124]. Thus, a joint strategy for the transformation of industrial regions is 
recommended.
5. R&D and innovation
The existing binational innovation and university networks should be used and expanded in order to 
develop and promote research & development cooperation opportunities in the field of hydrogen and 
to support research ac- tivities. Important research questions concerning electrolysis, hydrogen 
transport and storage as well as industrial applications could be jointly worked on. This should be 
supported by creating a regulatory framework that pro- motes cooperation of stakeholders from both 
countries. One focus should be on further studies regarding cost aspects, realisation and operating 
options for hydrogen production from offshore wind and subsequently the role of hydrogen in 
transforming the existing industrial value chain towards climate neutrality. Another focus should 
be on basic research in electrochemistry, such as electrolysis processes and the use of raw 
materials. In this con- text, also the transfer of information and the dissemination of new 
technologies, concepts and services between the two countries should be further supported by 
establishing a regular binational “Hydrogen innovation days” event, for example.
6. Perspective from the energy system level
Finally, the results of this feasibility study must be considered from a system level. It is 
recommended to examine more deeply what role offshore hydrogen production could play in a balanced 
mix of offshore renewable energy supply options in relation to national and European (offshore) 
renewable targets. The development of demonstra- tion projects in binational and European context 
addressing the system level value, such as within in the IPCEI program, should be supported by the 
Dutch, the German and the North Rhine-Westphalia governments.

2. Introduction
2.1.  Background

The European Union (EU) aims for a climate-neutral energy system by 2050 and is in the midst of the 
energy tran- sition. International cooperation is essential if this is to succeed. This is 
especially true for the Netherlands and Germany – countries that share both a land and a sea 
border. Furthermore, both countries have ambitious goals concerning the further expansion of 
offshore wind energy production and are front-runners in investigating and promoting hydrogen 
utilisation.

With the Joint Declaration of Intent on the Energy Transition, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and 
Climate Policy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and 
Energy of the Federal Republic of Germany declared their ambitions for energy policy cooperation. 
The declaration envisages the joint cross-bor- der development of offshore wind projects and 
infrastructure development in the North Sea region. Hydrogen with its potential to serve as an 
energy carrier, enabler of sector coupling and system integration, as well as a feedstock for 
several industrial processes was identified as a key topic. The development of European, Dutch, and 
German hydrogen strategies and the North Rhine-Westphalian hydrogen road map further establishes a 
political frame- work for hydrogen market development.

The trilateral project “Hy3 – Large-scale Hydrogen Production from Offshore Wind to Decarbonise the 
Dutch and German Industry” was initiated by the Netherlands, the Federal Republic of Germany, and 
the German Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). Its realisation is assigned to TNO as 
assigned party for the Netherlands, the research centre Forschungszentrum Jülich (IEK-3) as the 
assigned party for the German Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, and the Deutsche 
Energie-Agentur (dena) – the German Energy Agency – as the assigned party for the Federal Republic 
of Germany.

2.2.  Goals

The resulting study, which is the first of its kind, aims to assess the feasibility of a 
transnational green hydrogen supply chain in the Netherlands and Germany. The analysis time frame 
spans from 2025 to 2050.

Decarbonisation of a strong industry base in the Netherlands and North Rhine-Westphalia could be 
partly realised by green and low-carbon hydrogen deployment. Therefore, an examination of existing 
and potential field of hy- drogen applications in the industry and transportation sectors is one of 
the main goals of this research. The over- arching question is, how is the existing and future 
hydrogen demand in the Netherlands and North Rhine-West- phalia expected to develop?

Furthermore, the research aims to investigate the potential for green hydrogen production in the 
offshore and coastal regions of the Dutch and German North Sea. Today, a large-scale hydrogen 
production from offshore wind is still a visionary concept, but in the context of highly ambitious 
plans for offshore wind utilisation scale-up and electrolysis development targets in both 
countries, it could play a major role in the future. Therefore, the second

major goal is to answer the question: what are the potentials for hydrogen production from offshore 
wind in the Dutch and German North Sea?

In both the Netherlands and Germany, natural gas markets play a significant role in the current 
energy system. Moreover, transport and storage gas infrastructure of both countries is 
interconnected and serves a transnational gas trade. In the future, repurposed and upgraded gas 
pipelines and storages could provide a backbone for the potential transnational hydrogen market. In 
this respect, the third central question to answer is, how could the demand and supply centres be 
connected by the repurposed transport grid and storage systems in the Nether- lands and Germany and 
how can hydrogen supply and demand be matched?

Prospects for a future green hydrogen market are still hampered by various challenges. Although 
recent Dutch, German and European policy goals see an important role for hydrogen in the energy 
transition, sustainable busi- ness models for a large-scale hydrogen projects are yet to emerge. In 
the course of the research, a framework for a transnational Dutch and German hydrogen market is 
analysed, including value chains, green hydrogen competi- tiveness, and development of hydrogen 
backbone and regulatory issues. Thus, the final goal of the report is to examine the pathways and 
obstacles towards a potential transnational hydrogen market.

2.3.  Structure of the report

The initial step in the analysis is to determine technological aspects, market sectors, spatial 
distribution and the size of hydrogen demand. Hydrogen demand for industry and transportation is 
then modelled for the identified demand clusters in the Netherlands and North Rhine-Westphalia. 
These aspects are covered in Section 3, which was prepared by the Forschungszentrum Jülich (IEK-3).

Section 4, which was prepared by dena, offers an analysis of green hydrogen production from 
offshore wind. Anal- ysis was performed in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Energy 
Economics and Energy System Tech- nology (FIEE), which carried out the required modelling. It 
includes a roadmap for reaching full potential of off- shore wind in the Dutch and German North Sea 
and for the scale up of coastal and offshore electrolysis for hydro- gen. Hydrogen production yield 
and costs are modelled for several scenarios. Additionally, an assessment of CO2 emission savings 
from utilising green hydrogen is performed.

In Section 5, which was prepared by the TNO, hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure is 
examined, under the assumption of using mainly repurposed natural gas infrastructure in the 
Netherlands and Germany. To meet expected hydrogen demand, additional import routes are considered 
apart from hydrogen production from off- shore wind. Scenarios are modelled for the assessment of 
pipeline and storage capacities and potential bottle- necks.

Market potentials and barriers for the realisation of the envisaged transnational hydrogen market 
between the Netherlands and Germany are considered in Section 6, which was jointly prepared by all 
three institutions. Here, several aspects for market development are examined: value chains, cost 
of hydrogen supply, pathways for devel- opment of an international hydrogen backbone, and 
regulatory frameworks.

3. Hydrogen demand

The benefits of a transnational green hydrogen economy are firmly based on the expected future 
hydrogen de- mand scenario. The main drivers for hydrogen demand are market diffusion/adoption 
based on technology read- iness and underlying business cases. For this reason, Section 3.1 shows 
an assessment of relevant transportation and industrial hydrogen technologies, and Section 3.2 
offers an assessment of the future hydrogen market. Based on today’s demand, the possible future 
market diffusion of hydrogen technologies, together with the quality re- quirements for the 
hydrogen needed, are described. Finally, Section 3.3 quantifies the resulting hydrogen demand for 
NRW and the Netherlands in 2030 and 2050. A particular focus is on the sectoral structure and 
spatial distribu- tion of thy hydrogen demand.

3.1.  Technology assessment
Green hydrogen can be used in a comprehensive range of applications. In this study, transportation 
and industry are in focus. The advantage of using hydrogen as fuel or feedstock is that it does not 
lead to carbon dioxide emis- sions. In addition, combustion-based nitrogen oxide and particulate 
matter emissions can be avoided when using fuel cells for energy conversion. The following section 
assesses the available hydrogen-based technologies for transportation and industry together with 
its required hydrogen quality. Other applications and sectors, such as the electricity sector, are 
not being analysed but could play an important role in future demand and greenhouse gas reduction.

3.1.1.  Transportation
A wide range of hydrogen vehicles by various manufacturers is under development, with the first 
vehicles already available on the market. Available – or soon to be available – vehicles are buses, 
trains, heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) with a gross load above 3.5 metric tons, light-duty vehicles 
(LDVs) with a gross load under 3.5 metric tons, and passenger cars.
These vehicles use an electrified drive train where very pure hydrogen (> 99.999%) is converted to 
electricity in a fuel cell equipped with a system of more than 60% efficiency due to advantages in 
efficiency. The resulting elec- tricity then powers an electric engine. The use of an internal 
combustion engine would result in a significantly lower efficiency [1].

A fuel cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy under a continuous supply of hydrogen 
and air. Several fuel cell technologies such as alkaline or polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM), 
with different characteristics, are currently available on the market. For the requirements of 
vehicles, the PEM fuel cell has decisive advantages due to its high power density, compact design, 
easily controllable operating temperatures (approx. 80°C) and dynamic load behaviour [2]. The 
hydrogen is stored in gaseous form in tanks with high pressure of 350 or 700 bar, depending on the 
vehicle class. The ongoing discussion on technical standards for long-distance HDVs also includes 
on-board liquefied hydrogen storage.

The European Commission’s revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) has set a target for the 
transportation sector of at least 14% renewable energy in 2030 [3]. Additionally, the Clean Vehicle 
Directive of the European Union gives quotas for alternative drive trains in new procurements of 
buses and heavy-duty vehicles [4]. The main alter- native to motorised private transportation by 
fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) is battery electric vehicles (BEV). With their respective 
strengths, they complement existing FCEV technology. The market for FCEV is expected to grow 
rapidly in the next few years.

In comparison to BEVs, FCEVs enable high ranges and high payloads due to its low system weight and 
the high energy density of hydrogen. Refuelling an FCEV is similar to refuelling conventional 
passenger cars and is normally completed within three minutes [5]. Consequently, a high level of 
flexibility is ensured when using FCEVs. Never- theless, the efficiency of FCEVs is lower than the 
efficiency of BEV and the availability as well as the production volume of vehicles is limited, 
which leads to high vehicle costs. Both FCEV and BEV require a new refuelling infra- structure, 
including hydrogen refuelling stations or charging points, respectively.

Fuel cell bus
Fuel cell buses (FCBs) for public transportation are already developed, resulting in a technology 
readiness level (TRL) of 9, which means it offers a qualified system with proof of successful use 
[6] [7]. Currently, several manufac- tures offer fuel cell buses. Nevertheless, production 
quantities are still limited, and there can be longer delivery times. The operation of FCBs ensures 
usual procedures in a cross-line use for the bus operator, resulting in no bigger vehicle numbers 
for a FCB fleet than a usual conventional fleet [8]. A typical FCB comes with a tank size of 
approx. 40 kg at 350 bar pressure and consumes approx. 9.6 kg of hydrogen per 100 km [2] [9]. 
Consequently, the operating range is around 400 km, enough for service rural areas. Compared to a 
conventional bus that consumes
41.8 l crude-oil based diesel per 100 km, the fuel cell bus saves up to 1,053 g of CO2 per km if 
the hydrogen used is produced with zero GHG emissions [2].

Fuel cell train
Manufacturers deliver fuel cell trains for public transportation for use on non-electrified routes 
as an alternative to diesel trains. The TRL is 8, meaning a qualified system with proof of 
functionality in the field of application is pre- sent [6] [7]. As with buses, production 
quantities are still limited, and there can be longer delivery times. Fuel cell trains store around 
180 kg of hydrogen in 350 bar tanks and consume around 28.5 kg of hydrogen per 100 km [9]. Thus, 
the operating range can reach up to 600 km depending on the track profile. In comparison to a 
conventional train with approx. 129 l diesel consumption per 100 km, a fuel cell train saves up to 
3,300 g of CO2 emissions per km [10].

Fuel cell heavy-duty vehicle
Like fuel cell trains, fuel cell heavy-duty vehicles with a gross load of more than 3.5 metric tons 
have a TRL of 8, with proof of functionality in the field of application [6]. Vehicles in the 26 t 
class for distribution services are a particular focus of development. But the development of 
vehicles for long distances is also gaining traction. Again, production quantities are limited, and 
there are longer delivery times. For the exemplary case of distribution ser- vices, fuel cell 
trucks with a 350 bar storage capacity of 32 kg and consumption of 8 kg of hydrogen per 100 km, the


15 / 146
29.03.2022







operating range would be up to 400 km [11]. The fuel cell vehicle saves up to 670 g of CO2 per km 
in comparison to a comparable conventional vehicle with 26.7 l diesel consumption per 100 km [12].

Fuel cell passenger car
Fuel cell passenger cars represent a mature technology with a TRL of 9, i.e. a qualified system 
with proof of suc- cessful use [6][7]. Pioneering manufacturers are typically based in Asia. Even 
though the technology is mature in general, the availability on the market is still limited, as 
production quantities are limited. Hence, longer waiting times for delivery should be taken into 
account. Hydrogen tanks for fuel cell passenger cars store more than 5 kg of hydrogen at 700 bar 
pressure and consume less than 0.9 kg of hydrogen per 100 km [9] [13]. Therefore, the op- erating 
range is above 560 km per filling. The fuel cell vehicle saves up to 162 g of CO2 per km in 
comparison to a comparable petrol vehicle with 7.9 l/100 km petrol consumption [12].

Infrastructure needs
Fuel cell vehicles are refuelled at hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS), similar to conventional 
refuelling stations. Therefore, a widely distributed infrastructure is necessary. HRS are available 
in several sizes, which differ in dis- pense pressure, daily dispense capacity and dispenser 
number. The TRL is 8 [6]. Public small hydrogen refuelling stations with one dispenser and a daily 
dispense capacity of 200 kg at 700 bar can refuel more than 40 fuel cell passenger cars per day. In 
contrast, medium-sized HRS are typically used in non-public depots for buses or heavy- duty 
vehicles with two dispensers and a daily dispense capacity of 500 kg at 350 bar, which can refuel 
more than 20 fuel cell buses per day with a daily range of 250 km. Large HRS with four dispensers 
and a daily dispense capacity of more than 1,000 kg are still rare but could refuel up to 200 
passenger cars or 40 buses per day. Recently, new HRS projects show development towards HRS for 
parallel distribution of hydrogen with a pressure of both 700 and 350 bar. With such HRS, all road 
vehicles could be refuelled, ensuring improved utilisation rates of the HRS and in turn, better 
economic efficiency. This can be further improved by establishing modular HRS concepts that can 
flex- ibly respond to demand development [8]. The hydrogen can delivered by trailer with a capacity 
of up to 1,100 kg of H2 [2].

3.1.2. Industry
Hydrogen has the potential for significantly reducing the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions by 
using green hy- drogen from renewable energy sources. Today, natural gas, coal, diesel and 
liquefied petroleum gas are common energy sources for low and high-temperature heat, as their 
market prices are relatively low. Some industrial pro- cesses in the chemical industry and 
refineries use hydrogen as feedstock. Hydrogen used in these processes is typically produced by 
steam methane reforming of natural gas and carbon-containing residual gases, which means they are 
not climate-friendly.

Starting points for decarbonising the industry are the utilisation of green hydrogen, where 
CO2-emitting grey hy- drogen is used today, as well as a technology switch from processes that use 
fossil fuels to green hydrogen. Due to their high primary energy demand, the energy-intensive basic 
chemical industries’ ammonia and methanol syn- thesis, naphtha production in refineries, as well as 
steel, cement and glass production move into focus of the NRW



16 / 146
29.03.2022







Hydrogen Roadmap and this study [14]. These industries have a significant demand for 
high-temperature process heat.

Basic chemicals
The main processes of the industry for basic chemicals considered here are ammonia and methanol 
synthesis. As described in an analysis accompanying the hydrogen roadmap of North Rhine-Westphalia, 
ammonia is typically produced via the Haber process with hydrogen produced from steam methane 
reforming of natural gas [15]. The technological adaption is restricted to a substitution of grey 
hydrogen from steam methane reforming by green hydrogen from renewable energy sources. The existing 
technology is mature and consequently the TRL is 9. The total hydrogen demand of the process does 
not change by switching to green hydrogen. The required nitrogen must be provided by an air 
separation plant in the new configuration. An adaption of process components is re- quired. The TRL 
is therefore 8–9.

The situation is different for methanol synthesis. The hydrogen required for methanol synthesis is 
supplied by par- tial oxidation of heavy oil or steam methane reforming of natural gas. The 
additionally required process heat is supplied by burning heating oil, in addition to heavy oil and 
natural gas. Green hydrogen can be used for methanol synthesis, instead of grey hydrogen (if a 
carbon source is available) and heat production in the future. If the process heat is supplied by 
green hydrogen, hydrogen demand for methanol synthesis increases in comparison to the cur- rent 
process based on fossil fuels.

Naphtha, as one of the most important basic petrochemical materials, is generated from crude oil 
that is split in steam crackers to olefins and aromatics. The by-products hydrogen, heavy oil, 
refinery fuel gas and naphtha cracker-off gas are used for process heat. The power-to-liquid route 
using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is an alterna- tive option for producing naphtha in the future. 
Dechema specifies a TRL of 9 as of 2030 [16]. An alternative for providing process heat could be 
green hydrogen or electricity. A TRL of 9 is expected around 2035.

Steel production
Coal and coke are used today to reduce iron ore in a blast furnace to produce steel. This primary 
steel is comple- mented by secondary steel from steel scrap. As no iron ore has to be reduced in 
the secondary steel route, the energy demand is significantly lower. Nevertheless, this route is 
limited due to the availability of steel scrap. In the future, the use of hydrogen is a promising 
option for reducing iron ore as an alternative to coal and coke. The re- sulting sponge iron can be 
melted into steel in electric arc furnaces. A TRL of 9 is expected at around 2035 based on relevant 
projects [15] [17].

Process heat
Process heat generation in the industry is currently mainly based on the combustion of natural gas, 
coal or residual gases coming from industrial processes. More climate-friendly options are 
sustainable bio-energy and green hy- drogen. The production of high-temperature heat – above 400°C 
– is particularly hard to decarbonise as current heat pumps cannot be used in that temperature 
range. Green hydrogen can complement electrical process heat generation, depending on electricity 
and green hydrogen supply conditions [18]. The TRL is 9 [16].

3.1.3. Hydrogen quality
The different requirements of the individual components along the supply chain regarding the state 
and purity of hydrogen require purification, compression, and liquefaction. The selected way of 
hydrogen storage is amongst the most important variables defining the required processing steps. 
Electrolytic production of hydrogen is gener- ally facilitated between 1 and 20 bar, while hydrogen 
fuel cell applications for transportation operate at 350–700 bar. This pressure difference creates 
a significant pressure differential that must be bridged. Moreover, the high- pressure components 
of the hydrogen supply chain, such as high-pressure pipelines and 500 bar trailers, add even 
further constraints to the design of the supply chain.
Hydrogen purity requirements are primarily defined by the hydrogen quality constraints of the final 
hydrogen con- sumer. The polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEMFCs), which are the most common type of 
fuel cells among the trans- portation applications, have a 99.97% purity requirement for hydrogen, 
with orders of magnitude higher limits for individual contaminants such as O2, CO2, and H2O 
[17][1].
The levels of the required hydrogen purity vary among the different industry segments. Hence, 
varying purification needs for the demand applications in the specific industry have an impact on 
the final hydrogen delivery cost. The purity requirements range from 99.95% to 99.995% for general 
industrial applications providing, amongst others, high temperature process heat to 99.999% and 
99.9997% for semiconductors and special applications of gaseous and liquid hydrogen, respectively 
[18]. Furthermore, verification of hydrogen quality varies between the physical state of hydrogen 
(gaseous or liquid). Accordingly, industrial applications have requirements for hydrogen purity 
comparable to PEMFCs used in the transportation sector, leading to high purity requirements for the 
hydrogen supply chain. Requirements for high temperature heat applications can be lower; however, 
in order to utilize the network effects the infrastructure would need to be designed to meet the 
requirements of all consumer segments.

3.2.  Market assessment
Section 3.1 discussed the high technology readiness for most hydrogen applications in the industry, 
with transpor- tation close behind. Section 3.2 shifts the focus from a technical to a market 
perspective. It starts by presenting the current hydrogen demand for industrial applications in the 
steel and petro chemical and chemical industries, before discussing the total market potential for 
North-Rhine Westphalia and the Netherlands. Finally, a base mar- ket diffusion scenario based on a 
literature study is presented.
Ammonia, methanol, and steel plants and refineries will be assessed in order to estimate the market 
potential of hydrogen in the industry. Ammonia, methanol and steel plants are assumed to work with 
0.18 𝑘𝑔𝐻 /𝑘𝑔𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑎, 0.19
𝑘𝑔𝐻 /𝑘𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙 and 0.06 𝑘𝑔𝐻 /𝑘𝑔𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑙, respectively [19]. All non-recycled 
steel output is assumed to switch to DRI
2                 2
by 2050. In addition, synthetic naphtha to be used in the chemical industry is necessary to 
compensate the de- creasing production of crude-oil based naphtha as a consequence of emission 
reduction targets. Therefore, hydro- gen demand required for synthetic naphtha production is also 
included in the PtL group. Hydrogen demand for PtL applications is estimated by scaling German 
demand for fuels by the capacities of refineries both in North- Rhine Westphalia, and in the 
Netherlands [3-6]. Due to the electrification of the transport sector, declining crude- oil based 
fuel production is assumed to be replaced by PtL pathways, while maintaining the necessary 
industrial capacities in the region and the role of refineries as naphtha and synthetic fuel 
providers.
The future development of passenger and freight transport demand is taken from the climate pathways 
for the Germany study [2]. For the regional allocation the annual driving distances for vehicles 
within the Netherlands (except trains) are obtained from publicly available data, which is provided 
by the Dutch Central Agency for Statis- tics [20]. The figures for the average annual distance of 
Dutch trains (passenger and goods) are obtained from Eu- rostat [21]. The relevant data for 
transport demand in NRW is obtained from the NRW H2 Roadmap [15]. Due to the fact that the 
aggregation of NUTS2 regions is used, it can be seen as good approximation of the future allocation 
of transport demand. As reported by Cerniauskas et al., the weighted average efficiencies are 
calculated for the different transport segments by using the efficiencies of today’s and efficiency 
projections [22]. Based on this, the average annual distance and corresponding efficiencies are 
multiplied to project the respective hydrogen demand. Fuel consumption of cars, buses and trains 
for today is assumed to be 0.9, 9.7 and 28.5𝑘𝑔𝐻 /100 𝑘𝑚, respectively. Technical progress is 
expected to result in decreased fuel consumption of 0.63, 8.0 and 25.5𝑘𝑔𝐻 /100 𝑘𝑚, respec- 
tively. The efficiencies for LDVs and HDVs on the other hand depend on vehicle weight class. 
Conservatively, the maximum weights of individual categories are used in the efficiency calculation 
of these two vehicle classes.

As previously discussed, hydrogen as a commodity already has a wide range of applications in the 
petrochemical and ammonia industry. Given the high concentration of the chemical industry in NRW 
and the Netherlands, both regions have a substantial hydrogen demand (refineries, methanol, 
ammonia) of 17 and 41 TWh/a, respectively. As shown in Figure 1, the structure of current hydrogen 
demand in NRW and the Netherlands is similar, with excep- tionally high demand for ammonia in the 
Netherlands. Given the similarities of the current hydrogen market in these regions, the 
development of hydrogen demand in both regions can be analysed together meaningfully. This is 
because every similar policy measures can be easily applied to both regions, such as by creating 
hydrogen valleys that focus on local hydrogen clusters of industrial and transportation demand, 
which can support hydrogen mar- ket adoption.

19 / 146
29.03.2022







The allocation of the current hydrogen demand indicates two broader transnational demand clusters: 
the demand cluster along the North Sea coast, stretching from West to North, and the regions around 
the Rhine-Ruhr area, including the Limburg region in the southeast of the Netherlands. Hence, while 
large parts of hydrogen demand in NRW are concentrated in one area, which is supplied via a 
hydrogen pipeline, the demand in the Netherlands is substantially more distributed. While demand in 
the northern Netherlands can be supplied directly from offshore wind, green hydrogen supply for 
ammonia production in the Limburg area requires a more complex hydrogen in- frastructure 
development. However, given the relative proximity of Limburg to the demand clusters in North-Rhine 
Westphalia and the numerous existing natural gas pipelines between the regions, an integrated 
assessment will provide a more cost-efficient result. At the same time, hydrogen pipelines are 
envisaged in northwest Germany in order to connect the hydrogen production at the North Sea coast 
with NRW, neglecting potential synergy effects with the pipeline grid in the Netherlands [23].

Figure 2 depicts the overall structure for the potential hydrogen demand in both NRW (214 TWh) and 
the Nether- lands (292 TWh), making a total of over 500 TWh used in the further analysis. Not all 
potentials are additive; how- ever, as the demand for refineries is later substituted by the demand 
for PtL production as an example. In case of refinery, ammonia and methanol, current demand for 
hydrogen in both regions is used to determine the potential. The potential demand in NRW stands out 
due to the importance of the PtL and steel, as these two markets make up two-thirds of the overall 
demand potential. In the Netherlands, steel production plays a significantly smaller role. This is 
compensated, however, by an even larger refining capacity, resulting in more than 55% of the demand 
potential in the Netherlands from PtL.

Methodology
The underlying demand scenario for the NRW H2 Roadmap is derived using a model family largely based 
on FINE, the freely available model generator [12] [15]. With it, different energy flows of energy 
systems can be modelled in high temporal and spatial resolution and calculated in a cost-optimal 
way under the condition of GHG reduction targets. The individual model components are coupled with 
each other and applied iteratively so that the respec- tive strengths of the individual tools come 
to bear. This approach has several distinct features, which are:
▪  Detailed mapping of PtX pathways from primary energy to energy use
▪  Consistent consideration of sectoral interactions
▪  High temporal and spatial resolution of infrastructures and renewable power 
generation
▪  Mapping of future energy infrastructures (electricity, gas, H2) and storage with high spatial 
resolution
▪  Detailed representation of renewable potentials especially wind and PV as well as electrolysis 
sites
▪  Mapping of future global energy markets (e.g. hydrogen, synthetic fuels)
▪  Determination of robust and macroeconomically optimised GHG reduction strategies taking into 
account data uncertainties by applying new methods
The energy system model FINE-NESTOR (National Energy System Model with Sector Coupling) is the 
model applied to derive the scenario for hydrogen demand. It maps the national energy supply from 
primary energy supply to the conversion sector, right through to the end-use sectors. The sectors 
are represented in the form of technologies or process chains and linked via energy flows. The 
technologies are characterised in terms of energy, emissions and costs. The model is designed as a 
closed optimisation model with the objective function of the minimisation of total system costs. 
Investment decisions to reach a cost-efficient transition are modelled from the macroeconomic, and 
not from the microeconomic perspective. Therefore, the results do not reflect the decisions of 
individual mar- ket participants, but rather show an idealised picture where all costs in the 
system are internalised during the decision-making process. Furthermore, the results are subject to 
uncertainties related to technology development in the future, as projections for technical and 
economic parameters, such as investment costs and efficiencies, were applied in the assessment. The 
model represents only part of the national economy, meaning it is a partial equilibrium model. 
Given a CO2 mitigation path, the FINE-NESTOR model can be used to calculate the cost-optimal 
transformation strategy for the entire energy system required to reach the reduction targets for 
CO2 emissions.
The model has a temporal resolution in the hourly range in order to be able to represent the 
fluctuating feed-in of renewable energy and its effects in a problem-oriented manner. Particularly 
against the background of the increas- ing importance of sector coupling, a special advantage of 
the model approach is that all interactions of the energy system can be consistently taken into 
account. The model also uses a methodological approach that allows for cost uncertainties to be 
adequately addressed (see Lopion et al. [21]). Drivers of the model are energy consump- 
tion-determining demands (such as population development, gross value added, goods demands, 
transport de- mands, etc.), which are exogenously specified and are not part of the optimisation. 
The model is based on a myopic approach, i.e. on an approach that successively minimises the 
respective costs for the respective time intervals. To determine the transformation strategy, a 
back-casting method is used in a first step. It is based on the concept of first optimising the 
energy system of the target year as freely as possible and, based on the result, defining upper and 
lower limits for the systems of the intermediate time intervals. These are supplemented by the 
political bounds and other parameters derived from the stakeholder process during the preparation 
of the NRW H2

Roadmap such as reduction targets for CO2 emissions, energy supply strategy of NRW, network 
development plans, etc. [15]. Then, in a second step, the cost optimisation of the preceding 
intervals is carried out, analogously to a forecasting approach, within the set limit values. The 
basic procedure is summarised in Figure 3.






















Figure 3: General approach to derive cost-optimal transformation of the entire energy system with 
the FINE-NESTOR model 1: Scenario “2050Transformation Strategies” [24]. 2: North-Rhine Westphalia 
H2 Roadmap [15]

We derive generalised market adoption curves for each hydrogen market based on the NRW H2 Roadmap 
scenario due to the relative similarity of the energy systems and potentials of hydrogen demand 
between NRW and the Netherlands (see above). Figure 4 shows the market-specific adoption of 
hydrogen applications for transportation applications from 2025 to 2050. It can be seen that during 
the initial phase, up to 2030, train and bus markets experience the most rapid adoption of hydrogen 
applications. These are followed by hydrogen applications in cars and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), 
which reach similar levels of market adoption as trains and buses by 2040. In the long-term, by 
2050, the scenario expects the highest market shares for hydrogen vehicles in the HDV segment where 
more than three-quarters of the vehicles are fuel cell electric. In the case of passenger cars, 
buses, and trains, market shares between 40% and 50% are reached by 2050. The majority of the 
light-duty vehicles (LDV) are ex- pected to be battery electric vehicles due to the typically short 
daily mileage, and consequently, fuel cell applica- tions would reach only approximately 25% of the 
market in the long term. For a more detailed assessment of the transport sector and other 
drive-train types, please refer to the NRW H2 Roadmap scenario [15].

Figure 4: Market diffusion of hydrogen in the transportation sector for the base scenario

In addition to the transportation sector, hydrogen adoption is also expanded in the industry 
sector. Figure 5 pre- sents the derived market-specific diffusion curves for ammonia, methanol and 
steel production. It has to be noted that ammonia and methanol already have a hydrogen demand for 
feedstock and use reforming of heavy oil or natural gas to produce hydrogen. Therefore, for these 
markets, the diffusion marks the adoption of GHG-free hy- drogen substituting the current 
production processes. Thus, the substitution of the non-energetic feedstock could be an enabler of 
an initial hydrogen market development in the industry sector. It can be seen that the adoption



















Figure 5: Market diffusion of green hydrogen in the industry sector for base scenario

for ammonia is substantially faster than for methanol. Especially in Germany, a large amount of 
ammonia is pro- duced via partial oxidation of heavy oil, which is more GHG-intensive than natural 
gas and substituted first. More- over, methanol production utilises the by-product heat and CO2 
from the natural gas reformer, making a substitu- tion with GHG-free hydrogen more expensive than 
is the case for ammonia. In the case of steel production, market diffusion shows the increasing 
adoption of direct reduction of iron via hydrogen (DRI-H2) for steel production. While the first 
steel plants are being converted to the new process between 2030 and 2035, the long-term market 
adop- tion reaches over 50% in 2050 as the remaining energy for steel production is derived from 
electricity and other chemical energy carriers. A more extensive discussion of the industry sector 
and the role of other energy carriers can be found in the NRW H2 Roadmap scenario [15].
Further demand options such as hydrogen consumption for process heat or for production of synthetic 
fuels via power-to-liquids (PtL) are considered in the scenario. However, market diffusion for 
hydrogen is not displayed at this stage, as both options refer to an extensive set of further uses 
and applications such as synthetic diesel or synthetic kerosene, as well as non-energetic demand 
for chemical feedstock, making the market boundaries less defined. In addition, hydrogen use in 
refineries for desulphurisation of fuels is considered in the analysis, but not displayed in this 
figure. The demand for fossil fuels in the scenario will decrease significantly up until 2050 and 
the remaining liquid fuel demand will be replaced by green PtL. According to this, hydrogen demand 
for desulphuri- sation of fossils fuels will diminish by 2050.
In addition, in order to better assess the adoption scenarios of the individual markets, these are 
compared with the data from the literature. The following overview of scenarios (Figure 6) 
incorporates the relevant European and global market scenarios and adoption targets. In general, it 
can be seen that various scenarios yield a broad spec- trum of hydrogen adoption in 2050, 
indicating sensitivity to methodology and input parameters of individual sce- narios. However, it 
needs to be pointed out that despite the displayed uncertainty, even the most conservative 
estimates anticipate the share of fuel cell vehicles in local bus and non-electrified train fleets 
to achieve 20–25% by 2050, highlighting the role of these markets. Moreover, in the derived 
scenario, heavy-duty vehicles surpass the anticipated market adoption in other studies. Given the 
multiple weight classes of the trucks, numerous studies give a market adoption for the overall 
truck market, which is naturally smaller than market adoption in the indi- vidual weight classes. 
Generally, no scenario anticipates a fleet penetration larger than 20% by 2030, indicating a 
gradual market adoption after the initial commercialisation phase through 2030. Consequently, this 
indicates a
















25 / 146
29.03.2022







broader market adoption ten years earlier than later scenarios, highlighting the generally 
anticipated period of a decade to introduce the technology.

Lines indicate the penetration for the individual markets in the reference scenario. Grey area 
portrays the range provided in the analysed literature.
3.3.  Demand scenario

After technology availability is assessed and the market adoption scenarios for each market segment 
are set, the development of the hydrogen markets can be evaluated. It should be emphasised that the 
results are scenarios and not forecasts. Figure 7 shows the development and the structure of 
external hydrogen demand in both the Netherlands and North Rhine-Westphalia. For the industry 
sector, the following analysis considers only the share of hydrogen demand that does not occur as a 
by-product at the industrial site or is not produced at the site itself, thus onsite production as 
a by-product or onsite electrolysis is subtracted from the total demand to derive the quantities 
relevant for the development of delivery infrastructure. As previously discussed, both regions have 
a comparable overall potential for transportation and industrial demand, as well as many similar 
features regarding the structure of these markets. Henceforth, given that the same hydrogen 
adoption was assumed, both regions





26 / 146

develop in a comparable manner and total size of the demand, surpassing their current grey hydrogen 
demand between 2035 and 2040 in NRW and the Netherlands, respectively.





















Figure 7: Development of external hydrogen demand and its structure for the Netherlands and North 
Rhine-Westphalia from 2025 to 2050

A common market for both NRW and the Netherlands boosts potential hydrogen demand and can increase 
security of supply, while reducing the risk of stranded assets.

The structure of energy demand in NRW and the Netherlands for future hydrogen demand will be 
dominated by industry, especially the chemical and petrochemical industry, refineries, and high 
share of urban areas with high road, rail, and aviation fuel demands. In addition, the assumed 
demand scenarios consider non-energetic use by domestic green naphtha for chemical feedstock and 
products. The assumed hydrogen demand especially for pro- ducing PtL as transportation fuel and 
chemical feedstock is therefore different in comparison to scenarios with a national and not NRW 
focus, for example, in studies by Sensfuß, F. et al3 and DENA4. These scenarios assume lower shares 
of hydrogen demand in transportation and PtL. In the assumed scenarios the hydrogen demand starts 
to play a major role beginning in 2035 (NRW: 10 TWh, NL: 19 TWh), as hydrogen is consumed to 
produce various PtL products such as synthetic diesel and kerosene for road and air transportation, 
as well as for synthetic naphtha production required as feedstock in the chemical industry (see 
Figure 8).

A higher hydrogen demand for PtL is also allocated to the refineries in the Netherlands, rather 
than in NRW, given the higher capacity there. Given the similarity of the regions, other sectors 
such as industry, including methanol, ammonia, steel and process heat production, as well as the 
transportation sector have a comparable overall size. It can be seen that demand in both regions up 
to the year 2030 is primarily driven both by the transportation sector (NRW: 4 TWh, NL: 5 TWh) and 
the substitution of existing hydrogen demand in the refineries for processing of fossil fuels as 
well as in ammonia production (NRW: 2 TWh, NL: 11 TWh). In contrast, hydrogen demand for steel 
produc- tion and process heat plays a more important role after 2035 and 2045, respectively (see 
Figure 5 for comparison). This highlights the importance of substituting the existing hydrogen 
demand in the industrial sector during the ramp-up of a clean hydrogen market. In 2050 overall 
demand for hydrogen is anticipated to reach up to 162 TWh and 239 TWh in NRW and the Netherlands, 
respectively.























Figure 8: Development of the structure of hydrogen demand for PtL in NRW and the Netherlands from 
2035 to 2050

The highest concentration of hydrogen demand can be observed along the coastal regions in the 
Netherlands, as well as South Netherlands and the western part of NRW, reaching 6.2 TWh in 
Rotterdam, 3.9 TWh in Zeeland and
1.8 TWh in Maastricht as well as 1.6 TWh in Duisburg regions (see Figure 9). These are the same 
regions as the identified areas for allocating the current hydrogen and encompassing the major 
population centres in the Neth- erlands and NRW. The lowest demand is anticipated in the rural 
areas in the south-east of NRW with 0.5 TWh. Thus, all regions surpass the demand of 0.5 TWh p.a., 
which is an approximate demand threshold for cost-competitive- ness of a long-distance pipeline to 
trailer transport [24] [25]. If delivery is centralised, a hydrogen pipeline may offer a 
cost-effective means of hydrogen transport in 2030 already.

Figure 9: Regional allocation of external hydrogen demand in the Netherlands and North 
Rhine-Westphalia in the year 2030

A green hydrogen demand of about 6 TWh is anticipated in NRW for 2030, without taking into account 
current grey industrial demand. 73.8% of hydrogen demand can be allocated to the transportation 
sector and 20.2% to the industrial sector. The remaining demand relates to the external clean 
hydrogen demand in the refineries. In con- trast to NRW, the demand for hydrogen in the Netherlands 
would reach 15.5 TWh. Moreover, with 41.7% and 28.0%, the demand share of refineries and industry 
in the Netherlands is larger, as clean hydrogen is used earlier in those areas than in steel 
production, which assumes a dominant position in NRW (see Figure 10).

Figure 10: Overall and regional structure of external hydrogen demand in NRW and the Netherlands 
for 2030 (possible deviation from 100% due to rounding errors)
Hydrogen demand in the transportation sector of NRW adds up to about 4 TWh in 2030 (see Figure 11). 
The largest share of ca. 60% is for passenger cars. In 2030, HDVs already account for 25% of 
hydrogen demand in the transpor- tation sector, with a strong upward trend until 2050. Accordingly, 
demand is rather evenly distributed among the regions in western and central NRW. In the case of 
the Netherlands, overall demand reaches ca. 5 TWh, and the structure of demand is comparable with 
NRW. However, due to the smaller number of trains and busses, these markets play a somewhat smaller 
role in the overall hydrogen demand for transportation. Demand is mainly lo- cated in the western 
and central regions of the Netherlands, which encompass the majority of the Dutch popula- tion and 
vehicle fleet.

Figure 11: Overall structure and regional allocation of hydrogen demand of the transport sector in 
NRW and the Netherlands for 2030 (possi- ble deviation from 100% due to rounding errors)
As for the industrial sector in NRW, demand reaches ca. 1 TWh in 2030, and the demand centres 
correspond to the chemical industry and refinery sites as a wider adoption of hydrogen is yet to 
take place (see Figure 12). In general, the industrial sector’s hydrogen demand in 2030 is 
distributed among only a few selected counties. This can be justified by the fact that the use of 
external hydrogen is initially only applied in basic chemicals, where hydrogen is already used, for 
example, in ammonia and methanol production. Similarly, external industrial demand in the 
Netherlands (4 TWh) is primarily driven by the chemical sector (including ammonia and methanol), 
highlighting the importance of the low-hanging fruits during market rollout in the industrial 
sector.

29.03.2022






























Figure 12: Overall structure and regional allocation of external hydrogen demand of the industry 
sector in NRW and the Netherlands for 2030 (possible deviation from 100% due to rounding errors)
From a long-term perspective, total annual hydrogen demand in the final energy sector in NRW 
reaches ca. 162 TWh in 2050, excluding the conversion sector (see Figure 13). In contrast to 2030 
(dominance of transportation demand with 74%), 26% and 20% of this demand consist of industrial and 
transportation demands, respectively. The other 54% is used for PtL production at the refinery 
locations. This result demonstrates the strategic role of industrial and especially PtL hydrogen 
demand in NRW, which will significantly influence the design of hydrogen supply in the long term. 
Hydrogen demand is concentrated primarily in the western regions of NRW. In the case of the 
Netherlands, total demand in 2050 reaches 239 TWh and, due to the prominent role of PtL (70%) and 
concen- tration of the refineries in the West Netherlands, overall hydrogen demand is more 
concentrated than in NRW (see Figure 8 for PtL demand structure). The remaining 30% of demand are 
almost evenly split between industry and transportation.

Figure 13: Overall and regional structure of external hydrogen demand in NRW and the Netherlands 
for 2050 (possible deviation from 100% due to rounding errors)
Transportation demand in NRW reaches 32 TWh in 2050. In contrast to 2030, hydrogen demand for 
transportation in 2050 is dominated primarily by the demand for HDVs (44%) and passenger cars 
(48%), while trains and buses will play a minor role (about 8%) (see Figure 14). Nevertheless, as 
of today, they are essential for increased infra- structure utilisation and thus for economic 
implementation, especially in the introductory phase. In contrast to industrial consumption, demand 
for transportation is much more evenly distributed among the regions. One of the most important 
reasons for this is a high share of HDVs. Thus, high demand for hydrogen is also expected in less 
urbanised regions. A very similar picture develops in the Netherlands, where, at an overall 
transport demand of 35 TWh, 96% of transportation demand is governed by passenger cars and HDVs. 
With the majority of the popu- lation and vehicle fleet concentrated in the eastern and western 
Netherlands, these regions have the highest share of transportation demand in 2050.

29.03.2022






































Figure 14: Overall structure and regional allocation of hydrogen demand of the transportation 
sector in NRW and the Netherlands for 2050 (possible deviation from 100% due to rounding errors)

Industrial demand for hydrogen in NRW in 2050 reaches ca. 42 TWh and is dominated by steel 
production (around 58%) (see Figure 15). This is followed by high-temperature process heat for 
industrial furnaces or cement produc- tion and ammonia as well as methanol production with 
approximately 24%, 12% and 6%, respectively. In addition, about 8% of industrial demand is used for 
industrial furnaces. With over 25 TWh, the focal point of industrial de- mand for hydrogen in NRW 
is found in the western part of the region and particularly in the Rhine-Ruhr region with its 
prevalence of steel and chemical plants. However, the demand of ca. 37 TWh in the Netherlands for 
industry is substantially more decentralised, and two-thirds of demand revolves primarily around 
the chemical industry, such as ammonia and methanol production, with 47% and 17%, respectively. In 
contrast to NRW, demand for steel and process heat in the Netherlands makes up only ca. 19% and 17% 
of total demand, respectively. Consequently, a more evenly distributed supply infrastructure for 
industry will be required in the Netherlands.

4. Hydrogen production from offshore wind
Green hydrogen supply in this study presumes a process of electrolysis of fresh or desalinated sea 
water, powered by renewable electricity from offshore wind. Practical experiences in large-scale 
green hydrogen production are yet to be documented. Therefore, any scenario of potential 
utilisation needs a conceptual energy system, con- strained by various boundary conditions. In the 
case of potential green hydrogen production in the Dutch and German North Sea, national targets for 
offshore wind and green hydrogen production are considered, as well as distinctive supply chain 
concepts for hydrogen production, which is described in Section 4.1. In this regard, an assessment 
of offshore wind potential in the Dutch and German North Sea, resulting in electricity generation 
with hourly resolution, is performed and described in Section 4.2. Furthermore, Section 4.3 
presents hydrogen produc- tion scenarios. These include hourly time series of produced hydrogen for 
various combinations of possible oper- ating modes of electrolysers and assumed delivery points to 
the onshore hydrogen pipeline backbone. In the same section, an analysis of hydrogen production 
costs is conducted and the resulting levelised costs of hydrogen are presented. Finally, an 
assessment of CO2 emissions savings by utilising green hydrogen is performed, as described in 
Section 4.4.

4.1.  Supply chain concepts
In this study, hydrogen production was assessed for two distinctive infrastructure configurations, 
here named “supply chain concepts” (see Figure 16).

▪  Concept A – Onshore electrolysers: The electrolysers are installed on land (along the coast) and 
powered by electricity from offshore wind farms via a grid connection. Produced hydrogen is fed 
into an onshore hydrogen backbone pipeline (see Section 5).
▪  Concept B – Offshore electrolysers: The electrolysers are directly connected to the offshore 
wind farms and are located at offshore platforms together with sea water desalination facilities. 
Produced hydrogen is fed into an offshore hydrogen pipeline, which is connected to an onshore 
hydrogen backbone pipeline.
4.2.  Offshore wind potential assessment
Modelling of the development of offshore wind energy in the Dutch and German North Sea as well as 
modelling of the corresponding generation time series is based on available data for offshore wind 
energy areas, the latest plans for wind park project development and currently operational wind 
parks. Analysis was performed in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and 
Energy System Technology (FIEE), which carried out the required modelling. Detailed methodology and 
assumptions on technological and operational settings of wind parks and wind turbines can be found 
in Appendix B1. Hourly wind speed data from a numerical weather model (COSMO-REA6, Deutscher 
Wetterdienst) for the historical year 20125 is used as the meteorological input.

4.2.1.  Areas for offshore wind energy
Based on available information and assumptions (see Appendix B1), designated priority and reserved 
areas as well as possible additional areas for offshore wind production were determined for the 
German North Sea (see Figure 17).
Area development in the German North Sea in stages takes into account the following:
▪  Operational wind parks
▪  Planned development according to the area development plan and the spatial development plan 
[27]: first concrete projects/planned clusters, later via the LCOE model6 [26]
▪  By 2030: priority areas from the area development plan,
▪  By 2040: reserved areas according to the BSH with sequence derived from the LCOE 
model
▪  Additional areas in the shipping route (SN10) are included but developed with a lowest 
priority

Similarly for the Dutch North Sea, area development in stages is modelled according to:
▪  Areas from scenario IV “Sustainable Together” from the study “The Future of the North Sea” 
[28]
▪  Operational wind parks
▪  By 2025: tenders for wind farm zones as published by the Netherlands Enterprise Agency 
[29]
▪  By 2030: ca. 11.5 GW according to the PBL road map [28]



⁵ This year is also the basis for the FIEE European energy scenario and is used as a base year in 
the grid development plans by the German transmission system operators.

▪  Long term: full development of PBL scenario IV “Sustainable Together” [28]

Resulting offshore wind development in the first (2025) and the last reference year (2050) are 
shown in Figure 17.

4.2.2.  Electricity generation time series
The numerical weather model COSMO-REA67 provides meteorological data to determine an electricity 
generation time series. The characteristic power curve is determined synthetically from the 
assumptions for the plant config- uration, in particular taking into account the specific power. 
Subsequently, a smoothed power curve is obtained (see Appendix B1). The wind park shading (wake 
losses) is taken into account by using an empirically derived, wind speed dependent shading curve 
(also in Appendix B1). Finally, the electricity generation time series are obtained by multiplying 
hourly wind speed data8, corrected by wake losses, with the given power curve and the installed 
capacity. The resulting installed capacity and energy yields for the German and Dutch North Sea are 
shown in Fig- ure 19 and Figure 20, and detailed information on resulting installed capacity of the 
offshore wind parks, energy yield, average capacity factor and average full load hours for each 
reference year is available in Table 8 of Appendix B1. It should be noted that in the case of the 
German North Sea, presumed installed capacity does not include the

























Figure 17: Map of the developed offshore wind parks and resulting full load hours in 2025 (left)

development and will most likely not match the exact locations presented here

4.3.  Hydrogen production scenarios
The following hydrogen production scenarios from offshore wind are being developed by taking into 
account sup- ply chain concepts, the offshore wind potential assessment, possible deployment 
roadmap for the electrolysis ca- pacity as well as the hydrogen production scenarios and 
sub-scenarios. Aim of the scenarios is to analyse different approaches and their implications on 
scale, costs and timing of hydrogen production from the EEZ of the Nether- land and Germany in the 
North Sea. The scenarios provide a basis to analyse implications on import, transport and storage 
needs. The scenarios neither take into account the existing political goals and framework for 
utilisation of offshore wind potential for the provision of renewable electricity from offshore 
wind, nor do they analyse a sys- temic optimum for the right share of offshore wind potential to be 
used for renewable electricity in relation to renewable hydrogen. In this respect the scenarios 
should be considered as exploratory scenarios for hydrogen production from offshore and not as 
optimal scenarios or realistic forecasts.
The analysis was performed in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and 
Energy System Technology (FIEE), which carried out the modelling work.

4.3.1. Scenarios and deployment roadmap
A starting point in analysing potential ways to produce hydrogen from offshore wind was to explore 
several con- ceivable approaches of coupling offshore wind production with operation of onshore and 
offshore power-to-gas facilities. For each of the two supply chain concepts, two different 
operating modes for the electrolysers are con- sidered. By applying each scenario to assumed 
delivery locations to the onshore hydrogen backbone, four sub- scenarios in the case of Germany and 
eight sub-scenarios in the case of the Netherlands were modelled, as de- picted in Table 3.

For all scenarios, it is assumed that a significant part of offshore wind installations will be 
grid-connected. In this context simplified assumptions are made that a maximum of 24 GW of offshore 
wind power is connected to the onshore electricity grid on the German side in 2050, and a maximum 
of 26 GW on the Dutch side. In the case of the Netherlands, a conservative scenario for offshore 
wind assumes expansion up to 11.5 GW by 2030 and 26 GW by 2050 [35]. In both cases, these figures 
fit a recent detailed Fraunhofer IEE 100% RE scenario analysis for Germany and Europe. The 
remaining offshore wind capacity is used for hydrogen production.
Another important assumption is the simplification of the electricity and hydrogen transport routes 
by introduc- tion of three central feed-in points at the coast. The choice of their locations is 
based on the configuration of the existing gas grid and the envisaged hydrogen backbone 
configuration (see Section 5). The proposed grid configu- ration does not consider existing 
electricity grid development plans and should not be interpreted as an optimal system 
configuration. The main purpose of central feed-in point(s) approach is to allow spatial analysis 
and deter- mination of distances between offshore areas and onshore hydrogen pipeline backbone and 
costs of offshore grid and pipeline infrastructure. This simplification was necessary to reduce the 
number of sub-scenarios for a model- ling task and does not imply realistic or technically and 
economically optimal configurations. The proposed high- level approximation should be interpreted 
in this context only.

Scenarios A1 and A2 for onshore hydrogen production – assumptions:
▪  All offshore wind farms are connected electrically to the onshore electricity grid.
▪  In the German case, the entire offshore wind capacity is aggregated to feed into one onshore gas 
network point (near Emden). For the Netherlands, the offshore wind capacity is aggregated to feed 
into the gas grid at two different feed-in points (Rotterdam and Groningen).

Scenarios B1 and B2 for offshore hydrogen production – assumptions:
▪  Offshore wind farms located further offshore – in zones 4 & 5 of the German EEZ and clusters 3, 
4 & 5 in the Dutch EEZ – are not connected to the electricity grid and are directly feeding 
offshore electrolysers.
▪  In Scenario B2, for further offshore zones and clusters, additional electricity grid connections 
of 2 GW per zone or cluster are installed for technical reasons (for grid stability and support).
▪  Electricity produced at offshore wind farms located closer to the shore – in zones 1, 2 & 3 of 
the German EEZ and clusters 1, 2 & 6 in the Dutch EEZ – is fed into the electricity grid and is not 
used for hydrogen production.
▪  Hydrogen from individual electrolysers is transmitted to a collection point and then transported 
via a high-pressure pipeline to the defined feed-in points at the shore. The pipeline diameter 
varies between 250 and 1,100 mm (DN250; DN1100) as indicated in Appendix B2. The output pressure of 
the electrolysers is assumed to be 30 bar and is increased to 100 bar at the compressor station in 
order to provide sufficient pressure for transport via the pipeline [36].
▪  A central feed-in point is assumed for Germany (Emden) for determining the hydrogen production 
time series. For the Netherlands, the wind farms and electrolysers and the resulting quantities of 
hydrogen are divided between the two locations of Rotterdam and Groningen.
▪  The distances between the clusters and zones to feed-in points (Rotterdam, Groningen and Emden) 
are measured to assess which zones or clusters are connected to the electricity grid and which use 
offshore electrolysis (see Appendix B2).

Main features of the assumed hydrogen production scenarios are depicted in Figure 21, and an 
overview of the assumptions and methodology for each scenario is shown in Appendix B2.

Maximum supply and minimum supply scenarios
Mixed concept for onshore and offshore electrolysis and a maximum supply scenario and sub-scenarios 
for hydro- gen production are introduced by combining an A2 scenario restricted to a power supply 
only from offshore zones near to the shore wind and B1 scenario. The rationale is to provide a 
maximal potential hydrogen yield, which was then used in a supply and demand matching exercise 
within the analysis of the transport and storage infrastruc- ture in Section 5. Scenario A1 is 
considered a minimum supply scenario due to the smallest hydrogen yield as a consequence of the low 
full load hours achieved in this scenario (see Appendix B2). In the following sections of this 
study, these scenarios are referred to as maximum supply and minimum supply scenario.

Deployment roadmap for electrolyser capacities
A deployment roadmap for the electrolysis capacity from 2025 to 2050 is developed based on the 
following as- sumptions:
▪  Initial ramp-up based on the national targets for offshore wind expansion and electrolysis 
capacity
▪  Final capacity available in 2050
▪  Linear deployment using a constant production volume for Germany and the 
Netherlands.

According to the German National Hydrogen Strategy, 5 GW of electrolysis capacity will be installed 
by 2030, with another 5 GW by 2035 [37]. It is assumed that 1.5 GW of electrolysers will be fed by 
offshore wind in 2030. This is the starting point of the electrolysis deployment related to 
offshore wind. According to the results of the offshore wind production assessment and the expected 
expansion of the electricity grid, additional electrolysis would only be required from 2035 
onwards, but the expansion would then have to be massive. Since this is not plausible, a

continuous electrolysis deployment of 1 GW per year from 2030 is assumed instead. The determined 
electrolyser capacities for each scenario are shown in the Table 4.

According to the Dutch National Hydrogen Strategy, 0.5 GW of electrolysis capacity will be 
installed by 2025 and 3– 4 GW by 2030. It is assumed that all electrolysers will be fed by offshore 
wind. This is the starting point of electro- lyser deployment. An early start is necessary in order 
to achieve the maximum capacity by 2050. A constant elec- trolyser deployment of 1.5 GW per year is 
assumed between 2030 and 2050. The determined electrolyser capacities for each scenario are shown 
in the Table 5.

4.3.2.  Hydrogen feed-in points and offshore wind area aggregation
Three hydrogen feed-in points along the German and Dutch North Sea coast are considered for 
connection to a hydrogen backbone pipeline. Groningen and the port of Rotterdam are considered for 
the Netherlands. For Ger- many, Emden is considered because a gas network expansion is planned, and 
a connection to the H2 pipeline in the transport network is possible [38, 39]. Some of the areas in 
the German North Sea are closer to the Netherlands than to Germany. The connection of the German 
areas to Dutch locations was not considered because Groningen and Emden are so close to each other 
that the difference in distance is not significant for the cost analysis. Central points of 
connection to offshore wind areas were defined, which are used to determine the distance and the 
re- sulting costs of the hydrogen pipeline (subsea pipeline).
In Germany, a total of 24 areas were identified for offshore wind production. Figure 22 shows the 
aggregation of the German areas into 5 zones as used by the BSH [40]. In the Netherlands, there are 
a total of 53 areas for offshore wind production, aggregated into six clusters as shown in Figure 
22. The clusters and zones were determined based on the proximity of the wind farms in order to 
reduce the calculation efforts and number of results to a reasonable limit. These clusters 
represent wind farms with comparable wind conditions, water depth and distance to the shore and are 
therefore used for the aggregated evaluation of electricity production and the determination of the 
elec- trolyser performance for the scenarios. The distances between the clusters and zones to the 
feed-in points (Rotter- dam, Groningen, Emden) is determined to assess which zones or clusters are 
connected to the electricity grid and which use offshore electrolysis (see Appendix B2). These 
distances are needed to assess the cost of the subsea hydrogen pipeline. The costs of the 
electricity lines are determined using the distance directly to the shore.

Hydrogen production time series and installed electrolyser capacities
Electrolysis capacity and full load hours for the electrolysis are determined on the basis of the 
offshore wind pro- duction time series and the electrolyser output. The offshore wind production 
time series of the different areas for every reference year are aggregated for the respective zones 
or clusters. The maximum offshore wind power pro- duction of the respective zone or cluster 
available for electrolysis was set to an average of 85 percent10 of installed offshore wind 
capacity. This maximum offshore power output is used instead of the total installed capacity for 
determining the size of the electrolysis and the hydrogen production time series (see the section 
entitled Deploy- ment roadmap for electrolyser capacities).
All areas in the German and Dutch North Sea were aggregated into a hydrogen production profile for 
every refer- ence year for the evaluation of the onshore scenarios A1 and A2. For the evaluation of 
the offshore hydrogen sce- narios B1 and B2, the offshore wind production time series of the 
different areas on the German and Dutch North Sea are aggregated into several production time 
series for every reference year, according to the five zones for Germany and the six clusters for 
the Netherlands, respectively.
The resulting capacity of installed electrolysers is shown in Figure 23 and in Appendix B2. 
Additionally, modelled electrolysis capacity for the SEN-1 area¹¹ is 247 MW producing 24,107 metric 
tons H2/a, which is added to the pro- duction of hydrogen in zones 4 and 5 in the scenarios B1 and 
B2 for all reference years. SEN-1 is the first area for other forms of energy generation, envisaged 
in the German EEZ (see Section 6.5.1), that could accommodate a first pilot project for the 
offshore hydrogen production in Germany.
























¹⁰ Based on the calculated time series for each scenario/cluster the value of the maximum occurring 
power of the aggregated wind farms averages typically at 85% of the installed wind power
¹¹ SEN-1 has an area of 28.8 km², which is approximately 30% of the area of zone EN8.

Figure 23: Installed electrolysis capacity for the different scenarios and reference years at 
Emden, Groningen and Rotterdam

In accordance with the electrolysis deployment roadmap, first minor electrolysis capacities will be 
realised by 2030, with the exception of the SEN-1 area already existing from 2025 onwards. 
Initially, these capacities will be located onshore in immediate proximity to the feed-in points. 
First offshore electrolysis capacities in Germany are assumed in the model as early as 2035, while 
in the Netherlands, they are not modelled until 2040. The reason for the assumption of constrained 
offshore electrolysis capacities is attributed to the development of the zones and clusters further 
offshore at a later stage in this conservative scenario.
Figure 23 shows that the peaks of installed capacitates are to be expected in 2050. While installed 
capacities of over 20,000 MW are reached for the Emden (scenarios A1, A2 and B1) and Groningen 
(scenarios B1, B2) feed-in points, the maximum installed capacities for the Rotterdam feed-in point 
vary between 10,000–15,000 MW for sce- nario A1 and A2. The relatively low offshore electrolysis 
capacity for the Rotterdam feed-in point is due to the fact that only cluster 3 is considered for 
supply chain concepts B. Furthermore, the aggregated Rotterdam offshore wind areas in the clusters 
are smaller in size and have a decreasing offshore wind energy density towards the Eng- lish 
Channel.
Based on the duration curves for each scenario and reference year (available in Appendix B2), 
hydrogen production time series for all scenarios for Germany and the Netherlands and all reference 
years are calculated. Through ag- gregating these, the annual hydrogen production quantities for 
all scenarios for Germany and the Netherlands can

be determined as shown in Figure 24 (for an alternative depiction, see also Appendix B2). The 
duration curves are also used to determine an overview of the full load hours (see Appendix B2).

Figure 24: Hydrogen production quantities in metric tons per year for the different scenarios and 
reference years at Emden, Groningen and Rotterdam
In view of the installed electrolysis capacity and the load duration curves, a concurrent 
development of the annual hydrogen quantities can be observed. The model shows that large-scale 
deployment of onshore hydrogen produc- tion is foreseen as early as 2030 (especially in scenario 
A2), while substantial quantities of hydrogen produced off- shore (supply chain concept B) are 
expected from 2035.12
For all three feed-in points, Figure 24 shows that scenario A2 will have the highest output of 
hydrogen by the refer- ence year 2040, ensuring a potential hydrogen market ramp-up. Once the more 
distant zones and clusters have been developed and realised, similar quantities of hydrogen of up 
to 1.5 metric tons can be produced according to scenario B1 (and partially in B2) in Emden, and 
Groningen in the reference year 2045. A maximum amount of hy- drogen can be produced for all 
feed-in points and scenarios after the full expansion of the areas in 2050. The

are already in operation or under prepara- tion in both Netherlands and Germany.

smaller hydrogen quantities produced at the Rotterdam feed-in point can be attributed to the 
smaller installed electrolysis capacities in cluster 1, 2 and 3.
Figure 25 compares the minimum and maximum possible hydrogen quantities as the sum of all three 
feed-in points (DE: Emden + NL: Groningen, Rotterdam) from the minimum supply scenario (A1) and 
maximum supply scenario (A2 near-B1). The first significant quantities of approx. 0.5 million 
metric tons of hydrogen in scenario A1 (surplus energy use) can be produced in the reference year 
2035. An almost equal amount of hydrogen can already be en- sured from 2030 in the scenario for 
maximum hydrogen yield (maximum supply scenario). If the German and Dutch offshore zone and 
clusters were to be fully developed by 2050, this would result in 2.7 million metric tons of hydro- 
gen in the minimum supply scenario and in 7.1 million metric tons of hydrogen in the maximum supply 
scenario. Furthermore, a comparison of the offshore wind and electrolysis expansion shows a more 
constant rate of expan- sion for the maximum supply scenario. Here, the expansion rate varies from 
18 to 27%, while in the minimum sup- ply scenario it is 17–31%. Finally, in the analysed scenarios, 
electricity shares from offshore wind for hydrogen production vary between scenarios and reach 
higher values from 2035, when 10–50% of electricity from offshore wind is converted to hydrogen. A 
detailed overview of electricity shares for hydrogen production is available in Appendix B2.

4.3.3.  Hydrogen production cost assessment
This section assesses the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH). In addition to the levelised cost of 
electricity (LCOE; see Appendix B1 – LCOE Models), which were calculated based on the results in 
Section 4.2, this section presents

49 / 146
29.03.2022







a more detailed view on the other cost components of the LCOH calculation. The calculation of CAPEX 
and OPEX for offshore wind turbines is based on Härtel et al. (2018) and can be viewed in detail in 
Appendix B2.
For the onshore electrolysis, CAPEX cost curves are developed taking into account the installed 
capacity and the year of installation. A PEM electrolysis is assumed as the technology of choice, 
and a cost curve model is used13 (see Appendix B2). In order to account for the specific 
requirements of operating electrolysers offshore, additional technical aspects and costs for the 
offshore hydrogen production (“marinisation”) are included. For the hydrogen pipeline, the cost 
model developed is applied [36]. Details can be found in Appendix B2. The costs of repurposing 
existing offshore gas pipelines are expected to be significantly lower than the construction of new 
hydrogen pipe- lines. The cost of hydrogen production is calculated using specific cost per kg of 
hydrogen.
The levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) method allocates the entire hydrogen production costs, taking 
into account component replacement, interest rates, and residual values at the end of the economic 
lifespan. It is based on the annuity method with constant annual cost throughout the lifetime 
considered (Verein deutscher Ingenieure VDI 2012a, 2012b). The financing cost parameters for LCOE 
and LCOH are identical. The observation period (project time span) is 25 years, the interest rate 
amounts to 5%, and the cost escalation rate is 1.455%, which is the average inflation rate of 
Germany over the last 20 years [41].



















Figure 26: Hydrogen production cost for the different supply chain concepts and reference years at 
Emden, Groningen and Rotterdam.
Based on this methodology, hydrogen production costs for all sub-scenarios, reference years, and 
feed-in points in Germany and the Netherlands are determined, as shown in Figure 26. Additionally, 
the value range for the cal- culated cost of electricity from offshore wind – denominated as a wind 
farm LCOE – is depicted in Figure 27. The levelised costs of hydrogen (LCOH) vary between 6.30 
EUR/kg for sub-scenario DE A1 Emden, and 3.88 EUR/kg for sub-scenario NL A2 Rotterdam. In addition, 
Appendix B2 provides a detailed overview of each individual value.

Figure 26 shows that for all feed-in points and reference years, scenario A1 (surplus energy use) 
has the highest levelised cost of hydrogen. The only major deviation (with 6.30 EUR per kg H2) can 
also be traced back to the min- imum supply scenario. This is due to the fact that hardly any grid 
bottlenecks occur in the initial phase of offshore wind expansion, leading to a low electrolysis 
utilisation of only 890 full load hours. With an increasing utilisation of the electrolysers 
(higher full-load hours), the LCOH for all feed-in points in scenario A1 fall to below 5.00 EUR/kg 
in 2050, but still do not reach the cost of scenario A2 (fixed percentage of electricity).

The breakdown of LCOH into various cost components shows that the electrolysis costs excluding 
electricity con- sumption contribute 23% to total LCOH in scenario A1 compared to 12% in scenario 
A2. The main difference can be explained due to the significantly lower full load hours of the 
electrolysers, even with equal LCOE (see Figure 28). In absolute terms, the costs in A1 (1.11 
EUR/kg) related to the hydrogen production are more than twice as high as in scenario A2 (0.51 
EUR/kg). In principle, the same applies to the reference year 2050 (see Figure 29): a higher number 
of full load hours leads to better utilisation rates and tend to lower the specific costs of 
electrolysis per kg of hydrogen.

The gradual expansion and development of the more distant offshore zones and clusters in the German 
and Dutch EEZ lead to relatively lower cost for supply chain concept B over time (Emden and 
Groningen from 2040; Rotterdam from 2045 onwards) when compared with supply chain concept A.

The reasons for this are the different proportions of levelised costs of electricity (LCOE). In 
particular, the lower costs can be attributed to the difference between electricity and hydrogen 
transport costs and to increased full load hours of supply concept B (see Figure 30).

4.4.  Decarbonisation potential

4.4.1.  System boundaries and CO2 footprints
The decarbonisation potential of green hydrogen is one of the important drivers of the future 
utilisation of this energy carrier. An assessment of the decarbonisation potential is carried out 
following the results of modelling of green hydrogen production from offshore wind on the North 
Sea. For this purpose, the production process of green hydrogen from offshore wind, together with 
alternative hydrogen production processes and natural gas, is as- signed the respective CO2 
footprints. As alternative production processes, grey hydrogen¹⁴ and blue hydrogen¹⁵ are 
considered. The CO2 footprint is defined as the production-related emissions assigned to the 
production of 1 MJ of gaseous hydrogen or natural gas (methane). As the reference for comparison to 
business as usual, a fossil fuel comparator is considered. The comparator is defined by the EU 
Commission for emission calculations of biofuels and is appropriate here, because it served as a 
benchmark for the priority energy infrastructure category of elec- trolysers in the EU Regulation 
[49]. The analysis of the CO2 footprint does not take into account the direct use of electricity 
with a naturally lower CO2 footprint, as the produced hydrogen in this study is assigned to 
decarbonise the hard-to-abate sectors and applications in transport, refinery and PtL production as 
well as in the chemical industry.
Differences in total production-related emissions for the hydrogen quantities between the reference 
production process and the fossil fuel comparator represent the decarbonisation potential. In order 
to assess CO2 footprints, the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) methodology is applied. Various sources are 
considered in defining comparable sys- tem boundaries for the LCA [42, 43, 44]. Figure 31 shows the 
system boundaries that are taken into account when it comes to the hydrogen production LCA. The 
system boundaries for the LCA include the emissions related to the respective energy source, 
meaning to the electricity production from offshore wind and the production of the nat- ural gas 
(upstream emissions of natural gas exploitation and transport included), as well as emissions 
related to






¹⁴ Produced via steam methane reforming (SMR) or auto thermal reforming (ATR).
¹⁵ Produced via SMR/ATR with carbon capture and storage (CCS).


53 / 146
29.03.2022







the respective process of hydrogen production, together with the emission related to hydrogen 
compression nec- essary for transport via pipeline. In the case of blue hydrogen, emissions related 
to the handling of the captured CO2 (CCS) are also considered.
For green hydrogen production from offshore wind, a CO2 footprint (“Green H2”) is set according to 
the value pro- posed in the North Sea Energy study, as the analysed use case fits well with the use 
cases in this study [109]. For grey and blue hydrogen, emissions related to the natural gas 
production, defined as upstream emissions16, play a crucial role in the evaluation of the CO2 
footprint. Assumptions on the level of upstream emissions of natural gas are not unified17 in the 
literature, which leads to large discrepancies in assessing emissions related to blue hydro- gen. 
For the current study, the CO2 footprint for grey and blue hydrogen production is based on 
Timmerberg (2020) for the SMR process [46]. The values are representative for blue hydrogen from 
natural gas imported to Europe, with a methane leakage rate of 1.7%. The considered energy carriers 
and respective CO2 footprints are shown in the considered energy carriers and respective CO2 
footprints are shown in Table 6. A detailed overview of assump- tions and sources is available in 
Appendix B3."































¹⁶ Upstream emissions include emissions from extraction, processing and transport of natural gas 
until the point of production of hydrogen.
¹⁷ Upstream emissions of methane are strongly influenced by the “methane loss rate” during 
transport. The methane loss rate depends on different factors like distance between source and 
consumption locations, and the way it is transported (pipeline or LNG). [45]

4.4.2.  The decarbonisation potential of hydrogen deployment
The quantities from those scenarios with a minimal and a maximal hydrogen yield (see Section 3.2) 
and their cor- responding CO2 footprints are used to determine the total production-related 
emissions for the modelled hydro- gen production. Then, the decarbonisation potential is determined 
as CO2 emissions savings by taking into account cumulative annual differences of total emissions 
between all considered reference fuels and energy carriers. The emissions derived for the same 
energy consumption taking into account the fossil fuel comparator for the transport sector of 
Directive (EU) 2018/2001 of 94 g CO2eq/MJ are also considered [49]. The resulting cumulative 
savings of CO2 are shown in Figure 32 and Figure 33. Between 272 and 810 million metric tons of CO2 
emissions would be mitigated by deployment of green hydrogen from offshore wind as a replacement 
for fossil fuels from 2025 to 2050. CO2 mitigation in the case of blue hydrogen deployment varies 
substantially, depending on the source of natural gas. Thus, blue hydrogen can mitigate between 43 
and 90% of CO2 emissions compared to green hydrogen.

5. Hydrogen transport, storage and import
5.1.  Introduction
This section examines the hydrogen transport and storage infrastructure. This infrastructure 
connects hydrogen demand in the selected industry clusters in the Netherlands and North 
Rhine-Westphalia to the production of hy- drogen from offshore wind along the North Sea coast. To 
balance variability in offshore wind production and the resulting hydrogen production, the 
balancing potential of using large-scale subsurface hydrogen storage in the Netherlands and the 
north-western part of Germany is examined. In case of a mismatch between annual supply and demand, 
the role of importing hydrogen from overseas is assessed. Regarding the geographical scope of the 
study, import locations are limited to the western part of the Netherlands (the port of Rotterdam) 
and the north- western part of Germany (e.g. the port of Wilhelmshaven as a potential candidate for 
the import cluster).
Probable infrastructure scenarios are outlined for combinations of supply and demand scenarios. 
Envisioned hy- drogen networks are supplemented by calculations using a solver that minimises the 
total distance that the hy- drogen molecules must travel between the supply, storage and demand 
sites. Given the known gas grid capacities we estimate the utilisation of an envisioned hydrogen 
network, identify bottlenecks for transport and storage and explore actions to resolve constraints. 
Drawing on the overall analysis, we recommend actions to realise the hy- drogen network outlined in 
the scenarios over the next decade. We further qualitatively describe some potential infrastructure 
modifications needed to successfully implement combinations of scenarios for demand, supply, 
storage and import.

5.2.   Methods – hydrogen transport, storage & import infrastructure
5.2.1. Transport infrastructure network
Hydrogen transport infrastructure would consist of the transmission network of pipelines with 
compressor sta- tions spread across the network. In a letter published in April 2020, the 
Government of the Netherlands communi- cated its strategy on hydrogen along with a corresponding 
policy agenda [50]. The Dutch strategy states that the hydrogen transport infrastructure will 
likely develop as a network sector, as is the case with natural gas. In June 2021, the HyWay 27 
study was concluded anticipating a hydrogen backbone across the Netherlands and €750 mil- lion has 
been reserved for its development by the Dutch Government.18 Correspondingly, the Federal Ministry 
of Economic Affairs and Energy in Germany also published its National Hydrogen Strategy in June 
2020 [37]. The Ger- man strategy expects that parts of the existing natural gas network will be 
usable for hydrogen. Furthermore, ad- ditional networks are envisioned exclusively for transporting 
hydrogen. Reliance on the existing natural gas trans- mission network for future hydrogen transport 
is an underlying assumption in both the German and Dutch hydro- gen strategies.

The natural gas distribution network in the Netherlands is owned and operated by Gasunie N.V., 
whereas in Ger- many, there are 16 transmission system operators represented by the Association of 
Transmission System Opera- tors Gas e.V. (Vereinigung der Fernleitungsnetzbetreiber Gas e. V., 
abbreviated as FNB Gas) [51].
Both the Dutch and German TSOs have published their visions of a national hydrogen backbone. To 
analyse the transnational hydrogen infrastructure, we have taken the hydrogen backbone visions of 
the respective national TSOs as the starting point. For the Netherlands, Gasunie’s hydrogen 
backbone is used, and for Germany, FNB’s H2-Netz Vision is used [52] [53].
The backbone enables current and future demand centres (industrial hubs including chemical, steel 
industries and refineries) to be connected with supply location (electrolyser sites, overseas 
import) and storage sites (e.g. subsurface gas storages in salt caverns and porous reservoirs). See 
Figure 34 for the envisioned hydrogen net- work in the Netherlands and Germany.



















Figure 34: Envisioned hydrogen networks in the Netherlands (source: Gasunie) and Germany (source: 
FNB Gas)

As the proposed hydrogen network is largely based on existing natural gas pipeline corridors and 
infrastructure, we adopted natural gas network specifications such as pipeline length, diameter, 
number of lines and topology. Note that in this phase of the study, other modes of transporting 
hydrogen, for example, by truck, train and inland shipping are excluded. For the Netherlands, 
network topology in GIS-format was publicly available from the public- private research program 
North Sea Energy [54]. However, for Germany there was no public database containing detailed 
network topology in GIS-format that could be used. Therefore, this study relies on the network 
topology extracted in an earlier project at FZ Jülich based on the natural gas network published in 
ENTSO-G and publicly known network specifications [110]. An envisioned network topology consisting 
of demand, supply, import, and storage nodes is constructed by combining the information in a GIS 
database. In Figure 35, the envisioned network is projected on a map to show possible connections 
between production, supply, storage, and import clusters (or nodes). This map is then translated 
into a network model that simplifies the arrangement of the main elements of



60 / 146

the network (network topology). This yields simplified network topologies shown in Figure 36. 
Network simplifica- tion was in line with the supply, demand and publicly available German grid’s 
spatial resolution. The default net- work (Network = default) reflects an envisioned hydrogen 
backbone in the Netherlands and Germany. The variant of this network (Network = 
WithRotterdamDEpipe) includes a pipe segment from Europoort (Rotterdam, Nether- lands) to Wesel 
(Germany) via Venlo (Netherlands), in addition to the default network. This pipeline segment is of 
interest when transporting hydrogen directly from the port of Rotterdam to the southern part of the 
Netherlands and western part of NRW, and it has been considered in the hydrogen vision of the port 
of Rotterdam, for example [56]. Both network topologies include the entire envisioned hydrogen 
backbone for the Netherlands, and the en- visioned hydrogen backbone in the NRW region for Germany. 
The rest of the envisioned German hydrogen back- bone (outside NRW) was excluded from the model as 
those regions were out of scope, and consequently no de- mand/supply regional data was available 
for those regions.

demand, supply, import, storage and hub nodes modelled in transport analysis
For each pipe segment in the network, the corresponding pipe diameter and number of lines (i.e. 
parallel pipelines) were converted to an equivalent hydrogen flow by assuming 50 bar operating 
pressure and a temperature of 10°C with 20 m/s flow velocity. Note that both the operating pressure 
range and flow velocity are under detailed study

by TSOs and are subject to change in the future19. Project HyWay 27 estimates pipeline capacities 
of 10 to 15 GW for a 36-inch pipeline depending on the pressures. See the appendix for a comparison 
of capacities estimated via approach considered in this report and HyWay 27. Figure 36 shows the 
maximum flow capacity for the correspond- ing pipe capacity. The pipe capacity calculated includes 
the total capacity of all parallel lines. In Appendix C2, a similar network plot with the number of 
parallel lines is included for reference.



























Figure 36: Simplified network topologies showing the maximum flow capacity per pipeline segment

It is also assumed that the hydrogen pipelines can be used in both directions. This is needed for 
some parts of the backbone because significant amounts of hydrogen flow to the storage sites during 
periods of high oversupply (high production and import), and in periods of shortage, these stored 
volumes are made available again using the network in reverse direction.
5.2.2. Storage infrastructure
The intermittent supply and demand profiles during the year create hourly fluctuating deficits and 
excesses. In order to balance the flow in the hydrogen grid during hourly fluctuations, hydrogen 
storage in salt caverns is in-



¹⁹ Additional information was received from FNB Gas & Gasunie (HyWay 27 project team) during the 
course of this project expecting hydrogen flow velocities as high as 50 m/s. The consequence of 
this technical variation is elaborated upon in Appendix C1.

cluded in the study. Appendix C1 describes the formulae used to estimate the required volume of 
storage capac- ity. These storage volumes reflect capacity needed to balance a copper-plated 
rendition of the grid. Dynamic op- erating conditions, strategic reserves, security of supply 
targets, export buffers, etc. would likely require addi- tional storage capacity. These additional 
capacities magnitude and role of porous reservoirs to fulfil the need has not been investigated in 
the current study.

Selected storage sites and potential
Geotechnically suitable salt structures that could contain salt cavern(s) for gas storage are 
documented by NLOG and by LBEG for the Netherlands and Germany, respectively [58] [59]. An 
assessment of the suitability of these salt caverns and structures can be found in Juez-Larré et 
al. (2019) [57].
In the current study, salt structures with existing caverns are selected. While the caverns in 
these salt structures are currently used for storing natural gas, they could be re-used for storing 
hydrogen in the future. Additionally, new caverns could be developed within the same structures. 
Sites that have a geographical advantage resulting from their existing connection to the gas 
transmission grid, or due to their location along the border of the Neth- erlands and North 
Rhine-Westphalia, are identified and preferentially included. On this basis, the following pre- 
liminary list of salt cavern storage sites are identified and included in the analysis: Zuidwending 
(NL), Epe (DE), Xanten (DE) and Jemgum (DE). However, there are other salt caverns in the 
north-west of Germany that could also be used for hydrogen storage, such as Nüttermoor and Etzel. 
The chosen storage sites provide a broad spatial reach of the caverns with respect to the modelled 
grid. Since each site equally shares the injection and production needs from the grid, the chosen 
storage sites can be a proxy for other sites not explicitly included. For instance, from a 
modelling perspective, Jemgum could also represent Nüttermoor and Etzel. Figure 37 shows the salt 
cavern stor- age sites included in the transport analysis along with other potential salt cavern 
sites in the Lower Saxony area of Germany.

Figure 37: Salt cavern sites for potential storage and import. Transport analysis model includes 
the Zuidwending (S_1), Epe (S_2), Xanten (S_3) and Jemgum (S_4) salt caverns
There are several underground salt structures along the border region of the Netherlands and 
Germany near Gro- ningen (NL) and Lower Saxony (DE). Few studies have attempted to estimate the 
total onshore salt cavern storage potential. Caglayan et al. estimate that the Netherlands and 
Germany have a total onshore cavern storage poten- tial of ca. 400 TWh and ca. 10 PWh hydrogen, 
respectively [30]. However, in another study that focused on the potential in the Netherlands ca. 
43 TWh of hydrogen in over 300 salt caverns was estimated as a theoretical poten- tial [57]. In 
practice this theoretical potential is not feasible and it is expected that a maximum of 60 salt 
caverns could be developed in NL20 by 2050. The large difference in the estimated theoretical 
potentials is due to differing geometric cavern volumes, operating pressures and cavern spatial 
placements assumed by these two studies. This highlights that the estimated hydrogen storage 
potential is very sensitive to such parameters. Additionally, physi- cal and safety issues could 
also arise due to the proximity of salt structures to populated regions. All these aspects limit 
the practical salt cavern storage potential.

The Zuidwending storage site in the Netherlands has concrete plans to develop one cavern for 
hydrogen storage while possibility adding three more caverns for this purpose [61]. There is also a 
potential to add 10–20 more cav- erns given a total capacity of 3.5–6.0 TWh of hydrogen [60]. A 
detailed geological assessment for the Jemgum, Epe and Xanten sites in Germany is not published to 
the best of our knowledge. In this study we assume that these four sites have the potential to 
provide the storage capacities estimated in the next section. These four sites are located close to 
the existing gas transport grid. Salt cavern costs and time frames are shown in Section 6. Further 
site spe- cific scrutiny and geological assessment is needed to verify the required storage 
capacity estimates of this study. Based on discussions with industry stakeholders we foresee that 
existing salt caverns used to store natural gas could be re-purposed to store hydrogen within a 
time frame of 1–1.5 years for technical aspects. Non-technical aspects such as permits, social 
acceptance, etc. could take additional time. Some experts in this field project two to three years 
for repurposing salt caverns as this has not been done before. Creating new caverns at existing 
stor- age sites will take about two to three years for technical aspects. However, this does not 
account for additional time needed for hydrogen storage permits and other non-technical aspects 
such as social acceptance. This addi- tional time frame could take one to three years for the first 
few projects. Furthermore, the business case for hydro- gen storage in caverns is also being 
investigated. All these issues highlight the urgency in taking action such that sufficient hydrogen 
storage capacity can be available by 2030.

Storage site constraints
The maximum injection and production capacity of a salt cavern is limited by two factors. The first 
limitation is due to well size. For a typical well production tubing of 9 5/8 inches, a production 
of up to 136 metric tons/hr of hydrogen (= 4.5 GW) is theoretically feasible at a 80 bar difference 
between the cavern and wellhead, with a maxi- mum flow velocity of 100 m/s to not exceed the 
erosion threshold velocity [111]. The second limitation is imposed by the regulatory guidelines 
limiting the maximum pressure change over a 24 hour period to a set value. In the Netherlands, the 
allowed pressure gradient over 24 hours is 10 bar [111]. Since the cavern pressure changes due to 
injection and/or production of hydrogen, this poses a limitation to the maximum injection and/or 
production rate over a span of 24 hours. Considering the caverns located at the Zuidwending site in 
the Netherlands, with an average geometric volume of ca. 0.75 Mm3 (Energystock, 2017), a 10 bar 
pressure change translates to a sustained maximum flow rate (injection or production) of 20 metric 
tons/hr of hydrogen (= 0.65 GW) for the caverns. Based on the maximum production and injection rate 
analysis for the Zuidwending site, this results in a limit of 20 metric tons/hr of hydrogen flow 
sustained over a 24 hour period.

5.2.3. Import infrastructure
One of many options to supplement hydrogen supply is to import hydrogen at the port of Rotterdam 
(Netherlands) and the port of Wilhelmshaven21. In the current study, import from overseas is the 
assumed option to supplement hydrogen supply. By diversifying potential import locations, the 
overall grid utilisation can be distributed more evenly across the grid. Multiple import locations 
across different geographies could also aid in balancing grid flow variations during temporary 
supply and/or demand surges. According to the port of Rotterdam’s vision, the grid could support a 
combined self-production and import an annual throughput of 20 million metric tons of hydrogen


21 Note that this import node is assumed in the simplified network similar to the supply node 
denoted by DE_Em in Figure 36.

(666 TWh hydrogen equivalent, LHV) in 2050 (Rotterdam, 2020). The port of Wilhelmshaven has not 
published its hydrogen vision at the time of writing, but it remains an important port as it is the 
only German deep-water port. It currently has an LNG capacity output of 10 bcm (= 97.7 TWh 
considering 35.2 MJ/m3 gross calorific value) of natural gas per year [62].
The hydrogen import supply chain consists of four basic elements: a hydrogen conversion plant, an 
export termi- nal, shipping, and a reconversion terminal. The supply chain could be expanded as 
shown in Figure 38 depending on the mode of transport and the choice of energy carrier. Of the 
available energy carriers, liquid hydrogen transport, liquid organic hydrogen carriers and ammonia 
would be suitable for green hydrogen energy transport in terms of technology [112]. An additional 
supply of hydrogen will be needed in order to meet projected demand when supply is insufficient. In 
this study, it is assumed that any hydrogen deficit would have to be met by importing hydrogen from 
overseas through the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Consequently, the option of importing 
hydrogen at the port of Wilhelmshaven in Germany is also included in the analysis. Since the port 
of Wilhelmsha- ven is geographically close to Emden, Emden is considered as the import node in our 
network topology. This allows for performing a sensitivity analysis on the import location and its 
impact on the hydrogen grid. In transport sce- narios, where import from both the port of Rotterdam 
and the port of Wilhelmshaven is considered, the total an-

nual import was divided equally over both the import locations. Subsequently, the hourly import is 
calculated by assuming that the annual import is divided uniformly over the full year, i.e. a flat 
import rate over the year is con- sidered for simplicity. By this definition of the annual import, 
net hydrogen demand and supply (with import) over a given year is zero. Appendix C3 describes the 
formulae used to estimate import rates.


5.2.4. Hydrogen transport infrastructure modifications

Infrastructure elements
The future hydrogen transport infrastructure is anticipated to largely consist of converted 
existing natural gas in- frastructure. This network consists of several parallel pipelines in the 
Netherlands transporting high and low calo-



66 / 146
29.03.2022







rific gas. The recently announced HyWay 27 project considers reusing one of the pipelines to create 
a pure hydro- gen transport backbone ring in the Netherlands by 2027. Other pipelines are foreseen 
to become available after 2030. Other H2 carriers such as LOHC, ammonia and MeOH are not 
investigated in the current study. For instance, the infrastructure consists of several elements 
such as the pipeline, pipe fittings, valves, compressor stations and metering and control stations. 
All these elements must be screened for compatibility with hydrogen with clear guidelines on how to 
address them. To this end, engineering guidelines for gas network TSOs & DSOs are developed in the 
HYREADY project.
Re-purposing natural gas pipelines for hydrogen transport requires careful assessment of integrity 
loss due to hy- drogen embrittlement. Hydrogen embrittlement is a process by which diverse steels 
grades could become brittle and fracture due to exposure to hydrogen [63].
Other elements of infrastructure such as fittings, flanges and seals also need to be inspected for 
sufficient tightness to hydrogen. Pipe fittings that are leak-free for natural gas are not 
necessarily leak-free for hydrogen as hydrogen is a smaller molecule than most molecules in natural 
gas. Where needed, these elements need to be tightened or replaced to be compatible with hydrogen. 
Compressors would likely need to be replaced to be compatible with hydrogen [64]. Compatibility of 
metering and monitoring elements in control stations with hydrogen is currently investigated [113].
While there are many technical questions that still need to be addressed for the entire natural gas 
network’s com- patibility with hydrogen, Gasunie has modified an existing natural gas transport 
pipeline for use with hydrogen- rich natural gas (ca. 80% hydrogen, 20% methane) in the province of 
Zeeland (NL) [114]. The 12-km long, 16-inch pipeline transports hydrogen produced as a by-product 
at Dow chemical to Yara for consumption. The pipeline has been operational since November 2018 
[115]. Although used for transporting a hydrogen-rich gas mixture, this pipeline has been verified 
for use with 100% hydrogen [114]. In order to address technical questions for success- fully 
modifying nation-wide natural gas infrastructure to transport hydrogen, there are many ongoing 
projects by joint public and private consortiums focussing on the various aspects listed above 
[116].
Before existing natural gas infrastructure can be used for transporting hydrogen, the operational 
safety and maintenance procedures also need to be further developed, in addition to the technical 
challenges (Krom, 2020). The French network operators investigated technology-related and economic 
conditions for injecting hydrogen into natural gas networks [117]. They recommend integrating 10% 
hydrogen in the network by 2030 and afterwards increase to 20% in a sequential manner, parallel to 
upgrading the network to be compatible with 100% hydrogen.

5.3.  Transport analysis via network model
The transport analysis uses an energy system network model that balances flow through the network. 
The network is described by a series of nodes and connections. Here, the nodes represent the 
industrial demand clusters, sup- ply and import locations, and underground hydrogen storage sites. 
The connections represent the pipelines that connect various nodes with each other as described in 
Section 5.2.1.
The flow through the network is optimised by minimising the sum of the “flow-distance” parameters. 
Flow-dis- tance is the product of flow and pipeline length. Minimising the sum of the flow-distance 
parameters makes it pos- sible to identify the shortest flow path through the network. The model 
thus minimises the total distance that the

67 / 146
29.03.2022







hydrogen molecules must travel between the supply, import, storage, and demand sites for every hour 
of a given year. The minimisation model is additionally constrained by the corresponding supply, 
import, storage and de- mand values. This means that the network model should find a solution to 
absorb all produced and imported hy- drogen and meet the hourly demand in all individual demand 
clusters.
Import and storage rates are divided equally across all import and storage nodes. While the storage 
sites are fixed to four in this study, the number of import locations varies according to the 
specific transport scenario. The de- tailed energy system network model is described in Appendix 
C3.
Various transport scenarios are investigated to study the effect of demand and supply scenarios on 
the network topologies. The analysis is thus structured broadly to start with a baseline case upon 
which the sensitivity of cer- tain network features is studied. In this manner, a probable network 
operating strategy can be envisioned and potential bottlenecks in the network can be identified.

5.3.1. Selected scenarios
The transport analysis calculations are based on the demand and supply scenarios described in 
Sections 3 and 4. The baseline demand scenario is chosen and the minimum and maximum supply 
scenarios are chosen. The base- line demand scenario is based on the projected hydrogen demand for 
the Netherlands and Germany. The maxi- mum supply scenario gives an upper limit, whereas the 
minimum supply scenario gives a lower limit of green hy- drogen production from offshore wind. 
Several scenarios for the transport analysis are envisioned by combining the base demand and two 
supply scenarios for the years 2030 to 2050. For example, a transport scenario consisting of a 
combined base demand with maximum or minimum supply would cover potentially extreme import/storage 
and grid flow magnitudes over the years.
The baseline case transport scenario combines the default network topology (see Section 5.2.1) with 
hydrogen import at the port of Rotterdam from overseas. A sensitivity analysis studies the 
additional import capacity from overseas at the port of Wilhelmshaven. In scenarios where certain 
parts of the network have bottlenecks, it is as- sumed that the network capacity can be expanded by 
adding additional lines. Finally, in select scenarios, the Rot- terdam to Ruhr pipeline (Europoort 
to Wesel via Venlo) is included in the network topology to decongest the grid.

5.4.  Results

5.4.1.  Demand, supply, storage and import estimates
By comparing the annual demand and supply estimates over the years (2030 to 2050), the study shows 
that hydro- gen demand is higher than hydrogen supply. Demand growth over the years is exponential, 
whereas supply only shows linear growth. Figure 39 shows that annual hydrogen demand is higher than 
supply by 6–21 TWh in 2030 and by 162–310 TWh in 2050. This results in a need for an additional 
source of hydrogen to meet demand. In this study, we consider importing hydrogen as additional 
source of hydrogen.

Figure 40 shows the annual storage and import capacity from 2025 to 2050 for two transport 
scenarios consisting of combinations of the demand and minimum and maximum supply scenarios. The 
storage capacity needed to balance annual demand and supply fluctuations (including import) 
increase from 0.2–1.5 TWh in 2030 to 12–14 TWh in 2050. For all years, demand is greater than 
supply. In Appendix C4, an example plot of the storage site injection and production (without and 
with import) is shown.

A typical salt cavern with a geometric volume of 1 Mm3, operating at a working pressure of 75–190 
bar and located at a depth of 1050m has capacity of ca. 250 GWh of hydrogen energy (lower heating 
value) [118]. Assuming 250 GWh as the single cavern storage capacity results in the need for one to 
five caverns in 2030. This number grows to 49–57 caverns by 2050 (see Figure 41). Note that this 
estimate is based on a flat import rate throughout the year and an equal split of storage needs 
across the NL + NRW regions. The consideration of a dynamic import profile along with an optimal 
use of storage capacity can be used to optimise the number of caverns. With the estimates of the 
number of caverns that can potentially be made available (existing and potentially new ones) this 
means that sufficient storage capacity is available at all times based on the assumptions in this 
study. However, site-spe- cific storage potential assessments should be undertaken to verify the 
storage potential at the suggested locations. The estimated storage capacity needed is subject to 
the various assumptions considered in the supply and de- mand assessment such as flat import 
profile, weather profile for 2012, copper-plated transport rates, etc. Aspects such as effect of 
extreme weather year and variable import rate are not included in the analysis. Additional discus- 
sion on assumptions can be found in Appendix C.






















Figure 41: Number of caverns for baseline demand and minimum and maximum supply scenario assuming a 
single cavern capacity of 250 GWh
For the storage rates estimated for the transport scenarios, we calculate the maximum feed-in and 
production rate in a year that the sites would collectively need to match supply and demand. The 
instantaneous hourly feed-in and production rates are integrated to estimate daily (over 24 hours) 
feed-in and produced amounts. The daily amounts are then assumed to be fed in or produced from the 
storage site uniformly over 24 hours. The maximum feed-in and production rate refers to the maximum 
over a given year. For 2030, the maximum feed-in rate is 50 metric tons/hr (demand, maximum 
supply), whereas the maximum production rate is estimated to be 47 metric tons/hr (demand, maximum 
supply). For 2050, the maximum feed-in rate is 802 metric tons/hr (demand, maximum


70 / 146

supply), whereas the maximum production rate is estimated to be 755 metric tons/hr (demand, maximum 
supply). For all examined years, the number of caverns shown in Figure 41 would suffice to meet 
restrictions imposed by maximum feed-in and production rates. Consequently, there is no negative 
impact on the estimated instantaneous cavern feed-in and production rates in the transport analysis 
due to the regulatory limit of 10 bar on pressure change over 24 hours. Figures for maximum feed-in 
and production rates of the transport scenarios in 2030 and 2050 are shown in Appendix C3.

5.4.2. Transport scenarios
In the following sections we discuss the results from the transport analysis with the energy system 
network model up to the year 2050.

Year 2030
The envisioned grid has sufficient capacity for both supply-demand scenarios in 2030: demand with 
minimum and maximum supply. The figure below shows the mean flow through the network along with the 
normalised mean flow through the network for the maximum supply scenario with import at the port of 
Rotterdam. The mean is calculated over one year by calculating the hourly flow through the network 
linked to the hourly demand and sup- ply projections. The flow data at each pipe segment is 
available for analysis. Figure 42 [left] shows the maximum and minimum normalised flow for each 
pipe segment over the whole year. This is an indicator of grid utilisation. As the normalised flow 
values are close to 0, it shows that a relatively small portion of the total grid capacity is used. 
In Appendix C4, a detailed annual flow profile in a pipe segment is shown as an example for the 
level of detail available in the transport analysis model.

While the default scenario assumes that the entire gas network is available for pure hydrogen 
transport, it is con- sidered more realistic that hydrogen demand will gradually increase while 
reducing the natural gas usage [119, 120]. A dual network (or combined grid) with part for hydrogen 
and part for legacy natural gas users would likely co-exist during transition to pure hydrogen. To 
simulate a 2030 scenario consisting of a dual network, we reduce the number of parallel lines in 
the default network topology to contain a single line. Figure 61 shows the corre- sponding results. 
The results show that a single line network also has sufficient capacity to transport the projected 
hydrogen flows. Note that the actual change in normalised flow rate is too small for most pipe 
segments to visually stand out compared to Figure 42. However, small changes can be observed, such 
as the utilisation (normalised flow rate) of pipe segment with ID 3 (from NL_2 to H_2) increases 
when a single line is considered. In a nutshell, the grid capacity is sufficient in2030 to meet 
hydrogen transport requirements based on the estimates of demand, supply import and storage.

Year 2035
Compared to 2030, annual demand and supply more than double in 2035. The increased supply and 
demand cause the overall flow through the network to increase significantly. This higher flow in 
2035 is not likely to be supported by a single line network (detailed results in Appendix C4).
We further analyse the flow through the grid by assuming the entire grid is available for hydrogen. 
When import from overseas occurs at the port of Rotterdam, the local pipe segments near Rotterdam 
operate at maximum ca- pacity. These simulations are shown in the left column in Figure 43. The 
network diagram highlights the pipe seg- ment that operates at maximum capacity, whereas the red 
data in the normalised flow plot indicate the mean flow in that pipe segment. One of the ways to 
reduce the local pipe utilisation is to spread supply and import locations to other relatively 
underutilised locations in the grid. For instance, local pipe utilisation at Rotterdam could be 
reduced by spreading import of hydrogen between the port of Rotterdam and the port of 
Wilhelmshaven. These simulations are shown in the right column of Figure 43. Spreading import 
location between Rotterdam and Wil- helmshaven allows for operating the local pipe segments near 
Rotterdam below maximum capacity, freeing up capacity for possible contingencies.
These results should be placed in the context of the assumption that storage capacity is split 
equally across the four sites considered. Hence, more mitigation options to alleviate grid 
congestion are possible and need to be investigated more carefully, especially given the high 
uncertainties in projected demand and infrastructure as- sumptions used in this study.

Years 2040 and 2050
The annual demand in the years 2040 and 2050 is projected to increase exponentially, whereas the 
supply in- creases linearly from 2030 onwards. This has major consequences for grid utilisation 
based on existing topology and derived capacity. For instance, in 2050, spreading import over both 
ports considered in this study (Rotterdam and Wilhelmshaven) would be insufficient to decongest the 
grid (results in Appendix C4). We therefore assume that the grid is expanded by adding one 48-inch 
diameter line alongside the entire network22. Simulating this scenario, we find that the grid 
capacity would still be insufficient to transport hydrogen at the projected supply and demand 
estimates (see left column in Figure 44). As a select scenario, we added the pipe segment (Pipe ID 
35, Network = WithRotterdamDEpipe) from the port of Rotterdam to Ruhr (Europoort–Venlo–Ruhr) that 
is currently used for crude oil transport. In the future, this pipe segment can be replaced for 
transporting hydrogen. The resulting grid capacity with this expanded network was also found to be 
insufficient. However, by expanding the capacity of the pipe segment from the port of Rotterdam to 
Ruhr by one 48-inch diameter line, the grid has enough capacity, but grid utilisation is at a 
maximum at multiple pipe segments (see right column in Figure 44). These results show that parts of 
the hydrogen infrastructure require additional measures for resolving bottlenecks, especially 
around the import connections in these scenarios. Within this study, some of these debottlenecking 
approaches are explored, but more approaches should be examined to work towards a more optimal 
rollout of the hydrogen infrastructure. For instance, exploring the role of other import routes and 
cross-border NL-DE hydrogen grid expansion planning should be further evaluated.



























22 We also simulated a scenario (not shown here) where one extra line was added for pipe segments 
that are fully utilised. However, this sce- nario still led to bottlenecks.

6. Hydrogen market potentials and barriers
6.1.  Value chains and business models
The emergence of a functioning market is a prerequisite for the realisation of large-scale green 
hydrogen produc- tion in the offshore and coastal regions of the North Sea, in order to be able to 
supply demand centres in the Neth- erlands and North Rhine-Westphalia. An assessment of the needed 
value chains is carried out in this study to eval- uate the main aspects for potential business 
models.
The main aim is to provide an overview of the complex interplay between technical and market 
aspects. The value chains considered here take into account infrastructure configurations in the 
scope of the study: hydrogen supply concepts (concept A and B) and hydrogen pipeline transport, 
hydrogen underground storage, and hydrogen de- mand (energy or feedstock in industry and mobility 
sectors). Market functions, energy infrastructure, stakeholders, and a market design are described 
alongside the value chains. An overview of the status quo for the value chains is shown in Figure 
45.

The following insights could be derived for each part of the analysed value chains:
▪  Electricity production and supply from offshore wind plays a part in both value chains. Offshore 
wind farms utilisation on the Dutch and German North Sea is a functioning part of the value chains. 
Wind park operators access and operate wind parks under conditions set by national laws and 
regulations that in- clude tendering processes (as described in Section 6.5). Supply of electricity 
is a competitive activity with a support mechanism in place for some projects, while recent and 
future projects supply electricity in a free market environment. Main risks include practical 
realisation of a massive scale-up of offshore wind capacities (as described in Section 4.2) and 
uncertainties with regard to expected future cost decline of electricity production (as described 
in Section 4.3.3).
▪  Offshore hydrogen production and supply is relevant for the value chain with respect to the B 
variant. Currently, offshore electrolysis is at an early stage of development, hence no practical 
experience exists. High penetration of offshore wind leads to favourable market conditions for 
green hydrogen production (e.g. potential benefits of integrated system development of electricity 
and hydrogen infrastructure, need for flexibility and adequacy, lower overall marginal production 
cost of electricity). However, the establish- ment of a regulatory and market design for hydrogen 
production and supply on the Dutch and German North Sea is a prerequisite. A future regulatory and 
market design (as described in Section 6.5) needs to recognise synergies with offshore wind markets 
and address costs and benefits in comparison to direct electrification, among other aspects. It 
should also address green hydrogen supply competitiveness (see Section 6.3). As part of 
investigated scenarios, offshore electrolysis comes into play in the mid-term from 2035 (as 
described in Section 4.3.1).
▪  Offshore electricity transmission is a part of value chain A. Designated transmission system 
operators are developing and operating grid infrastructure under conditions regulated by the state 
and the respective regulatory bodies. Similar to electricity production from offshore wind, main 
risks include practical and timely realisation of necessary grid infrastructure to support a 
massive scale-up of offshore wind capaci- ties. Innovative concepts such as hybrid cross-border 
configurations could come into play.
▪  Offshore hydrogen transport by pipeline is necessary in case of value chain B. Currently, 
offshore hydrogen pipelines are not in operation but there is a large number of operating offshore 
gas pipelines in the North Sea. Cross-border offshore pipeline configurations could be beneficial 
for project realisation and should be investigated. The same is true for the utilisation of 
existing gas infrastructure. A regulatory and market design for hydrogen pipeline transport needs 
to be established together with one for offshore hydrogen production.
▪  Onshore hydrogen production and supply is a part of Hy3 value chain A. Currently, onshore 
electrolysis is being tested and demonstrated in numerous pilot projects on a small scale. Beside 
opportunities men- tioned for the offshore hydrogen production, additional renewable energy sources 
(e.g. solar) and tech- nological synergies (e.g. hydrogen-to-power deployment, utilisation of 
oxygen as a sub-product) could bring additional benefits. The realisation of a large-scale green 
hydrogen production from offshore wind and supply on the Dutch and German North Sea coast depends 
on the future regulatory and market design (as described in Section 6.5). Similar to offshore 
electrolysis, it needs to take into account synergies with the offshore wind market and address 
costs and benefits in comparison to direct electrification. It should


77 / 146
29.03.2022







also address green hydrogen’s competitiveness (see Section 6.3). Onshore electrolysis will be 
deployed already in the near term as a part of the investigated scenarios (as described in Section 
4.3.1).
▪  Onshore hydrogen transport by pipeline and hydrogen storage in underground caverns is necessary 
in both value chains. Currently, there are a few hydrogen pipelines used exclusively for feedstock 
transport in the chemical industry, operating in a non-regulated environment. Underground hydrogen 
storage is currently being tested. Infrastructure for natural gas is already available and could 
partially be repurposed in the short term for hydrogen transport and storage. To allow future 
large-scale transport and storage by (mainly) repurposed gas infrastructure, regulatory and market 
design needs to be aligned to enable the transition from the current natural gas market (see 
Sections 5 and 6.5).
▪  Hydrogen procurement and consumption is the final link in both value chains. Currently, there is 
limited hydrogen consumption in industry and in mobility from fossil-fuel based hydrogen that is 
operating in a non-regulated environment (see Section 3). Decarbonisation of the existing demand 
sectors and adoption in several applications are opportunities for green hydrogen in the relative 
short term. This includes po- tential synergies of hydrogen consumption technologies with other P2X 
technologies, synergies of hydro- gen in other sectors, and the advantage of limited to no change 
in consumption patterns. Additionally, future demand is highly concentrated in the Netherlands and 
North Rhine-Westphalia, which potentially reduces risks when establishing the whole value chain. 
Barriers and risks include limited availability of components (industry) and vehicle types 
(transport), lock-in effects (industry using grey hydrogen, transport using other fuels), high 
cost-sensitivity of the industry, lack of available refuelling infrastructure, elevated upfront 
investment for potential new hydrogen consumers and uncertainty of future technolog- ical change.
Several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis of the value chains in question. First of all, 
various precondi- tions need yet to be ensured in order to enable sustainable business model for 
large-scale green hydrogen produc- tion in the offshore and coastal regions of the North Sea, which 
can supply demand centres in the Netherlands and North Rhine-Westphalia. Those include bridging the 
gaps in market functions, energy infrastructure, stakeholders and market design. Opportunities for 
the future establishment of enabling market conditions include the existing and functioning 
offshore wind and natural gas market, as well as existing demand for grey hydrogen. To enable a 
large-scale green hydrogen market in the investigated scenarios, it is necessary to reduce the 
risks and uncertain- ties described above. This should include cross-border alignment on market 
formation and support schemes for early adoption of green hydrogen production and consumption. 
Policymakers should find a balance between long- term stability, adaptive flexibility and 
transparency. Complexity and interdependence of those issues brings about the necessity of 
coordinated, effective and viable plans.

6.2.  Total cost of hydrogen supply

This section aims to assess the total costs of hydrogen supply for the supply chains that encompass 
hydrogen production from offshore wind, transport and storage of hydrogen, and delivery to the 
demand centres in NRW and the Netherlands. To analyse the total costs, transport and storage costs 
(LCOT) are added to the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) and levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH). 
This is presented in Figure 46. State levies, taxes and any form of grid utilisation fees are not 
included in this analysis.

Min. supply scenario (A1)        Max. supply scenario (A2near - B1)
Figure 46: Total cost of hydrogen for min. and max. supply scenarios for each reference year

The total unit costs for the LCOE and LCOH were calculated using the weighted mean of the provided 
hydrogen quantities to the three feed-in points Emden, Groningen and Rotterdam. The increase in 
LCOE over time, especially in the minimum supply scenario (A1), is due to several aspects: the 
decreasing capacity factor results in lower full- load hours, which leads to an increase in the 
LCOE. This increase is additionally amplified by the development of the more distant offshore 
areas, as water depth, distance to shore and foundation depth are included in the calcu- lation (a 
detailed overview of all considered cost components of the LCOE is given in Appendix B1).

The calculation of the LCOT is based on findings from Section 5. The starting point is the pipeline 
network of over 5,000 km and the number of storage caverns required for the respective supply 
scenario (see also Sections 5.4.1


79 / 146
29.03.2022







and 5.4.2). Medium demand is chosen as the divisor for determining the unit costs. The cost 
assumptions for pipe- line refurbishment are based on the findings of the European Commission’s 
meta-study [65]. The FNB proposal of
0.37 million EUR/km in investment costs is used to determine the refurbishment costs from natural 
gas pipelines to a dedicated hydrogen infrastructure. The IEA assumption of 17 EUR/MWHH2 is the 
reference for determining the levelised cost of storage (LCOS), which is included in the 
“transport” section of the bar graph.

Figure 46 shows that high costs for green hydrogen are to be expected, especially in the initial 
phase of a hydrogen ramp-up. In the case of the minimum supply scenario, H2 costs reach 7.22 EUR/kg 
in 2030 and, for the maximum supply scenario, costs of over 5.50 EUR/kg for the reference years 
2025 and 2030. Infrastructure costs are particu- larly significant due to the initially low demand. 
The gradual increase in demand leads to decreasing infrastructure costs. Over time, this leads to 
costs for the minimum supply scenario of around 5 EUR/kg and, for the maximum supply scenario, to 
costs well below 5 EUR/kg. In this regard, possible cost recovery instruments should be consid- 
ered for the initial hydrogen ramp-up to avoid first-mover disadvantages. This could include 
various forms of direct support mechanisms as well as regulatory adjustments in depreciation and 
amortisation regulations (e.g. reduc- ing-balance methods).

6.3.  Benchmarking cost of hydrogen
A cost comparison between green hydrogen from the North Sea region (scenario A & B) and green 
hydrogen from other regions in the world was carried out in this study. The results are shown in 
Comparison of cost assumptions for hydrogen production cost in different studies and publications 
in Appendix B. This allows for a comparison of cost with selected results from other publications.

For this purpose, a cost range was determined from the three feed-in points Emden, Groningen, and 
Rotterdam for Scenario A and B in the respective reference years. The MENA region (Middle East and 
North Africa) was chosen as a comparative reference for green hydrogen, as full load hours and the 
designated linkage type (via pipeline) are comparable to the Hy3-project scope [66]. The cost 
ranges for all hydrogen products shown in Figure 47 refer solely to the levelised cost of hydrogen 
and exclude LCOT and other components.

Green hydrogen from the North Sea region converges by 2035 at costs between 3.90–5.30 EUR/kg. The 
levelised costs of green hydrogen from the North Sea become more and more consistent due to larger 
production volumes, increasing full-load hours and the expansion of offshore wind and electrolysis 
capacities in the North Sea. Com- pared to the levelised costs of hydrogen from the MENA region, 
the costs are advantageous at the beginning and remain competitive over time. The resulting LCOH 
are relatively high compared to the literature values because a different approach and different 
assumptions were used here. In particular, the LCOH in this study includes asso- ciated costs for 
transporting electricity or hydrogen to the coastal feed-in points. A comparison of LCOH cost as- 
sumptions is available in Appendix B2.

Apart from the import of a carbon neutral hydrogen, significant quantities of low carbon hydrogen 
could be sup- plied in the form of blue hydrogen. Blue hydrogen is produced via the utilisation of 
natural gas reformation (NGR) with sequestration and carbon capture and storage (CCS) (see also 
Section 4.4). Such low carbon hydrogen could be produced in the region, possibly from produced or 
imported natural gas. Other options could be to produce it in the gas export countries and then 
import it to the region via pipeline or ship. Blue hydrogen production technol- ogy is yet to be 
exploited on a large scale and the potential production costs are being intensively discussed in 
the literature.

For the purpose of this analysis, costs of blue hydrogen production are calculated using the EWI 
Excel tool “Esti- mating global long-term supply costs for low-carbon hydrogen from renewable 
energy sources and natural gas” [67]. These are determined on the basis of the deposited IEA 
dataset (e.g. European gas price development pro- jected by the IEA, additionally varied by a 
premium/discount of 25%). The resulting cost levels are in the following ranges: 2.05–2.60 EUR/kg 
in 2025, 2.19–2.76 EUR/kg in 2030 and 2.24–2.78 EUR/kg in 2035. The calculation of the

81 / 146
29.03.2022







longer term trends for the levelised cost of blue hydrogen results from the assumptions of 
declining natural gas prices, declining CAPEX costs as a result of further R&D and rising CO2 
prices (assumed at 59 EUR/tCO2 in 2025, 88 EUR/tCO2 in 2030 and 110 EUR/tCO2 in 2035. It is worth 
noticing that the cost of CO2 transport and storage is not included in the blue hydrogen production 
cost. Figure 48 shows cost components of blue hydrogen production in 2030.

This study did not take a closer look at other aspects of potential blue hydrogen production and 
supply. For exam- ple, in terms of the cost aspect, more ambitious CO2 pricing strategies could 
influence the cost ranges described above in the future. The same is true in the case of an upward 
development of natural gas prices in contrast to the declining trend assumed by the IEA. Logistics 
and costs of CO2 transport and storage could also play a role in as- sessment of specific use 
cases. Furthermore, an issue of methane leakages in the course of natural gas exploration and 
transport value chain is yet to be thoroughly addressed by policymakers. Finally, the advantages of 
domestic energy production and public acceptance need also to be taken into account. In this 
respect, further investigation is needed for a comprehensive analysis and benchmarking of various 
hydrogen production technologies and value chains.

As stated above, these cost assessments allow for a comparison of results from other publications. 
It then becomes clear that cost estimates for production of green and blue hydrogen, as well as 
import of low carbon hydrogen are highly subject to uncertain assumptions. These originate mainly 
from the uncertain cost projections for dominant cost factors. We already showed that for green 
hydrogen production in Germany and Netherlands, the full-load hours, capital cost assumptions for 
the electrolysers and electricity costs from offshore wind dominate the out- come of the levelised 
cost of hydrogen. Under the assumptions in this study, the prices for green hydrogen con- verge at 
4–5 EUR/kg. For blue hydrogen we see cost estimates between 2–3 EUR/kg in 2035. The key 
uncertainties for this source of hydrogen are the year of the cost estimate, natural gas price, 
cost of CCS and the CO2 price, which are still uncertain. For natural gas and CO2 emission 
certificates (under the ETS), we see high price variability in recent years, and short- and 
long-term projections are therefore highly uncertain.

The literature also recognizes this large range in cost estimates. Green hydrogen costs range 
between 1.1 and 4.1 EUR/kg (see Appendix B2 for a comparison of several sources). This indicates 
that the capital costs for electrolysers, the load factor (electrolyser and offshore wind) and LCOE 
assumptions for offshore wind used here are quite con- servative. All such conservative assumptions 
lead to higher cost estimates for green hydrogen production in com- parison to selected literature 
sources. It is not justified from this perspective to make strong conclusions on what the exact 
price of hydrogen will be. However, there is a clear downward cost trend for green hydrogen 
production in Germany and Netherlands and it is expected to become competitive with blue hydrogen 
production and im- port – however, highly dependent on the prevailing and future commodity prices.

6.4.  Possible transition pathways for developing an international hydrogen backbone
6.4.1.  Developing an international hydrogen backbone – setting the context

Legitimacy
The EU has set ambitious targets for developing hydrogen before 2030 in its Hydrogen Strategy and 
Energy Inte- gration Strategy23. An important element for regional, national and international 
developments towards achieving these goals is the social justification for developing a hydrogen 
infrastructure. This is not self-explanatory for all stakeholders involved. Creating long-term 
legitimacy for this activity as soon as possible is paramount to ensure that these actions are 
publicly validated and endorsed (see Dacin et al. (2007) and Rao et al. (2008), for example [68, 
69]). Legitimacy needs to be created for both the hydrogen backbone concept as a whole, as well as 
for the individual infrastructural elements it consists of (demand clusters, transmission pipelines 
and distribution net- works, storage sites, compressors, etc.) to prevent project delays affecting 
the critical development path. Addition- ally, sector coupling of hydrogen and electricity markets 
(offshore wind, offshore and onshore electricity grid ex- pansion) will have to be addressed in the 
planning process. This could be a coordination of infrastructure devel- opment but also a wider, 
integrated energy system approach when assessing costs and benefits.



²³ Green hydrogen production capacity may reach 40 GW by 2030, as stated in the European Hydrogen 
Strategy.

A clear benefit of an internationally connected hydrogen infrastructure is that it enhances energy 
system flexibility and security of supply. In the case of pipeline failure or outages, the sketched 
infrastructure has alternative rout- ings to transport the hydrogen. Overall, pipeline transport 
capacity can be better planned, resulting in a better use of the network. In the case of hydrogen 
storage outages, other storage sites can take over this function. If one hydrogen source shows 
bottlenecks, then other supply routes can balance the system (i.e. multiple import route entry 
points). A more extensive infrastructure also increases the amount (and volume) of demand sectors 
and clus- ters, most likely resulting in more demand side flexibility. Consequently, a larger 
network with better interconnec- tions is expected to have a higher resilience.

The backbone
This study outlines an envisioned backbone topology based on visions from national hydrogen 
developments in both the Netherlands as well as specific regions within Germany. The concept that 
TSOs are currently pursuing is to use current hydrocarbon infrastructure and convert it where 
possible [70, 71]. This approach is also the starting point of this study. Hydrogen storage is also 
assumed to be part of this initial infrastructure in the form of subsur- face cavern storage. In 
the future network the demand clusters are geographically situated around existing indus- trial 
clusters and nodes. The landing points for offshore hydrogen production, onshore hydrogen 
production loca- tions, or overseas import hubs (Rotterdam and Wilhelmshaven in this study) are 
important “new” hubs for the development needs of the transport infrastructure. This sets an 
important framework for the evolution of the net- work.
A key question is to determine to what extent current natural gas transport capacity can be made 
available for dedicated hydrogen transport while natural gas transport is still necessary. Section 
5.2 discusses this in more de- tail. For this study, it is assumed that parallel pipeline segments 
can be made available for hydrogen transport. If at least one pipeline line is available on the 
backbone route, then hydrogen transport capacity is not likely to be- come a bottleneck in the 
early years. Yet, this depends strongly on the demand and supply estimates and assumes certain 
operating conditions of the pipeline network (i.e. flow velocity and pressure).

Critical path
The timing of transitional pathways towards a dedicated hydrogen backbone is of high interest to 
all parties in- volved. Some elements of the backbone can be achieved in short time frames (years), 
while many elements can take several years from initial feasibility study to commercial operation. 
Examples from natural gas storage pro- jects and pipelines show that the preparation phase 
including feasibility assessment, investment decision and permit phase can take several years for 
large-scale infrastructure elements (see Table 7 for indicative ranges of lead times). The 
conversion to hydrogen pipelines comes with additional challenges, because hydrogen demand and 
supply volumes as well as natural gas transport obligations (as the important framework) affect the 
availabil- ity of certain pipeline segments.
The preliminary analysis in this study indicates that network congestion can occur. If it does, it 
will do so in situa- tions near import and production hubs that need to cope with high temporal 
flows in certain periods of the year. The network can also become congested if for certain parts of 
the network just one pipeline line (in the case of parallel lines) can be made available for 
dedicated hydrogen transport. Then congestion may occur in scenarios

with high demand and supply. Possible network congestion occurs from 2035 onwards. In this period, 
natural gas still has an important role to play in the Dutch and German energy systems, even if 
hydrogen supply and demand is growing quickly. Roughly 15 years between now and 2035 provide 
sufficient time for strategic planning under multiple and uncertain scenarios, but action is 
warranted now. It is critical to already highlight which legacy infra- structure is of high value 
to a possible future hydrogen backbone. This can help the design of a network topology at an early 
stage and to earmark legacy pipelines and storage locations for hydrogen transport and storage. 
This could already inform strategic spatial planning decisions on the regional, national and 
international level and limit critical delays in the period from 2030–2040. Against this 
background, possible transition pathways are outlined for the next decades, with each period 
showing its own characteristics and challenges.

6.4.2.  Possible transition pathways towards an international hydrogen backbone

The 2020s: from initiation to first realisation
In the period up to 2030, the area under study is assumed to convert minimally ca. 3,000 km of 
natural gas transport pipelines and establish about six caverns for subsurface hydrogen storage. 
The backbone will be largely estab- lished at the end of the twenties, but supply and demand 
clusters are still in a transition phase. Hydrogen demand from early adopters in the industry and 
other sectors is matched by supply from offshore wind and import from overseas. The challenges for 
this decade are: the development of a blueprint for the years to come, establishing legitimacy, the 
initiation of strategic spatial planning across borders, the creation of an integrated market and 
the removal of institutional challenges.
Technical transport and storage capacity are not a weak link on this path. Cross-border capacity is 
already planned for a new connection between Vlieghuis and Kalle which will be ready for operation 
in 2025, as well as a conversion of a pipeline at the border connection Elten/Zevenaar, which will 
be ready for operation in 2030 (see maps in Sec- tion 5.2.1). However, a sustainable business case 
given the expected low initial utilisation rate of the established network will be of interest.

The 2030s: growing demand and supply for green and low-carbon hydrogen
In the period from 2030 to 2040, the main challenge is to achieve large growth towards 126 TWh 
(range: 76–177 TWh) of annual demand. To facilitate this large-scale growth supply chain 
constraints have to be removed. These constraints can be market factors in offshore wind, hydrogen 
production and import, but also in the demand sec- tors that hamper wide-scale adoption of hydrogen 
against the backdrop of possible alternative routes for decar- bonisation.
Technical transport and storage capacity are expected to become limited only in the case of high 
demand and if certain parallel pipeline sections (or sections that do not have parallel pipelines) 
cannot be made available in time for dedicated hydrogen transport. This period sees the first 
transitional challenges of moving from natural gas to hydrogen. A complex and interdependent 
combined grid planning for hydrogen and natural gas is warranted for this period and onwards to 
start making available pipelines (existing or new) for hydrogen transport. Most likely this decade 
is dominated by uncertainty about the rate of decline of natural gas consumption.

The 2040s: steep growth towards maturity
In the period from 2040 to 2050, the main challenge is to maintain the large growth spurred in the 
thirties, pushing it further towards 401 TWh (range: 240–547 TWh) of annual demand. With more than 
5,000 km of converted natural gas pipelines and almost 60 hydrogen storage caverns, the market 
should have reached maturity, enabling inter- national trade and price setting across borders on a 
wide scale. Green and low-carbon hydrogen production and consumption is assumed to be commercially 
sustainable.
The transport and storage infrastructure requires the removal of bottlenecks around the most import 
connections. In certain periods the capacity of the backbone is put to the test. But ample time is 
available up to 2040 and on- wards to see early warning signs for transport and storage bottlenecks 
and adjust strategic planning accordingly and to expand transport and storage capacity.

Orchestration: coordination and guidance
The illustration of this transition pathway shows that large uncertainties about the future rollout 
of hydrogen in- frastructure in north-west Europe still persist. A very high level of coordination 
and guidance is needed to realise the ambitious cross-border hydrogen backbone visions over the 
next decade(s). To add to the challenge, coordi- nation and guidance is required on all 
infrastructural elements of the hydrogen backbone to overcome multifac- eted technical, market, 
regulatory and societal challenges.

6.5.  Regulatory framework
A suitable regulatory framework is necessary in order to establish the supply chains presumed in 
this study. Power- to-gas facilities, pipelines and underground storages for hydrogen are yet to be 
utilised on a large scale. There are various uncertainties regarding the legal treatment of the 
infrastructure in question – also regarding the market rules under which they will operate in the 
future. The following sections focus on the regulatory framework for specific aspects of a hydrogen 
market, including production from offshore wind, transport and storage operations. How these 
aspects currently fit into European and national regulations, foreseeable developments, and what 
could be done to tackle the uncertainties and regulatory gaps are addressed in this section.

6.5.1.  Hydrogen production from offshore wind
Hydrogen supply concepts taken into account in this study (see Section 4.1) include onshore and 
offshore electrol- ysis (power-to-gas facilities), offshore electricity grid and subsea hydrogen 
pipeline infrastructure. Theoretical in- frastructure configurations are positioned in the North 
Sea Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and in the case of off- shore electricity grid and subsea 
pipelines, also in the territorial waters25 of the Netherlands and Germany. Cross- border 
infrastructure is not considered for the assessment of the hydrogen production potential, but this 
could make technical and economic sense in a project-specific environment and should thus be taken 
into account.
Both the Netherlands and Germany have an established and functioning regulatory framework for 
offshore wind markets, while the rules for power-to-gas facilities are still to be fully developed 
and implemented. However, in the context of future developments, adjustments to the regulatory 
framework both for offshore wind and for the hy- drogen sector are already under discussion or in 
the early phase of implementation. Those developments include a rapid and massive scale-up of 
offshore wind capacities, fostering of innovations26 for reaching overarching de- carbonisation 
goals, spatial planning, environmental protection, etc.

Regulation at the European level
An ambitious vision of large-scale deployment of renewable hydrogen electrolysers is envisaged for 
the European Union. It is recognised that to drive hydrogen development past the tipping point, an 
enabling regulatory frame- work will be required, as expressed in “A hydrogen strategy for a 
climate-neutral Europe” [74]. A particular chal- lenge in large-scale deployment of power-to-gas 
facilities lies in the fact that sector coupling of the electricity and gas sector, in terms of 
their markets and infrastructure, still lacks a suitable legal framework within European Un- ion 
legislation. A comprehensive overview of technological and regulatory gaps and barriers for sector 
coupling is described by the European Commission’s report [75]. One of the central questions with 
regard to regulation of power-to-gas facilities is their legal classification. It is essential to 
clarify their status: as end consumer of electric- ity, gas producer, power-to-energy storage/gas 
storage and/or fully integrated network component [76]. The EU Directive on common rules for the 
internal market for electricity prescribes conditions for energy storages and fully integrated 
network components, but further clarifications are needed (ibid.) [77]. In this regard, the EU 
Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and the Council of European Energy 
Regulators (CEER) have made recommendations on how to regulate power-to-gas facilities and 
stipulate a necessity for [78]:
▪  Revision of definitions for major activities in the context of integrated gas and electricity 
sectors
▪  Treatment of investment and management of the facilities as market based activities
▪  Limitation of system operator’s role only to exceptional cases
▪  System needs analysis when deciding on installation and location
▪  Definition of cost-reflective network tariffs
▪  Avoidance of distortive effects of taxes and levies
▪  Insurance of traceability of renewable energy

These issues need to be tackled within the transposition of the EU Directive on common rules for 
the internal mar- ket for electricity and in the establishment of a revised regulatory framework 
for competitive decarbonised gas markets, which is envisaged for the second half of 2021 [79].
Connecting coastal or offshore power-to-gas facilities to an offshore wind electricity source 
brings additional com- plexities. “An EU Strategy for Energy System Integration” proposes key 
actions for energy system integration 27[80]. Among others, the strategy aims to ensure continued 
growth in the supply of renewable electricity and follow-up regulatory and financing actions, the 
cost-effective planning and deployment of offshore renewable electricity, taking into account the 
potential for on-site or nearby hydrogen production, and strengthening the EU’s industrial 
leadership in offshore technologies. Furthermore, “An EU strategy to harness the potential of 
offshore renewable energy for a climate neutral future” outlines a framework for utilising offshore 
potentials in the context of plan- ning, investment barriers, the regulatory framework, private 
sector investment and EU funds, research and inno- vation, and supply and value chains [37]. The 
strategy clarifies the regulatory framework, announces future steps in view of amendments and 
revisions of legislation28 and announces guidance on cost–benefit sharing for cross- border 
projects [81].

Regulation at the National level
The German National Hydrogen Strategy announced a plan for establishing hydrogen generation 
capacity from offshore and onshore energy generation facilities [37]. Furthermore, the strategy 
announced cooperation with North and Baltic Sea Border nations to push forward hydrogen production 
by establishing a reliable regulatory framework for offshore wind energy. Currently, numerous 
power-to-gas facilities are already operating as demon- stration or pilot projects29. However, 
several uncertainties and regulatory gaps for a large-scale deployment need to be considered. 
Power-to-gas facilities are classified as end electricity consumers due to a lack of definition and 
are thus burdened with a renewable energy surcharge, which is paid by electricity consumers to 
finance the rollout of renewable electricity generation. Recently adopted amendments of the 
Renewable Energy Law (EEG) add spe- cific provisions30 in view of partly or fully removing the 
obligation to pay the EEG surcharge on the electricity used for the electrolysis process [82]. 
Following a classification as an “installation storing electrical energy”, power-to- gas facilities 
with a capacity greater than 100 kW are obliged to provide redispatch services. However, 
classification as a form of “electricity storage” is not entirely certain [74]. Furthermore, there 
is the issue of legal qualification as “green electricity” of electricity used by a power-to-gas 
facility while connected to the offshore transmission grid and the resulting qualification as 
“green hydrogen” of the hydrogen produced. This issue can be tackled either by

conditions for qualification of hydrogen production as “green” with regard the origin of the 
electricity used for the electrolysis. Also, the new EEG 2021 has been designed by Germany as a 
state aid mechanism and requires a notification procedure to the EU Commission.

demonstrating that dominantly renewable electricity was used in hydrogen production due to the 
direct connec- tion to the offshore transmission cable or by otherwise certifying renewable origin 
of the electricity [83]. Another uncertainty31 to be considered is the necessity for a power-to-gas 
facility to obtain an authorisation pursuant to the Federal Emissions Protection Act, which 
includes comprehensive administrative procedures including public participation [84].
An offshore wind market in Germany is well-established. The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic 
Agency (BSH) is responsible for the development of areas in the German North and Baltic Sea EEZ for 
the construction and opera- tion of offshore wind farms based on the Wind Energy at Sea Act [85]. 
Winning a competitive tender procedure for offshore wind farms (OWFs), organised by the Federal 
Network Agency (BNetzA), is a prerequisite for a planning permit and the right to feed the 
electricity produced into the national grid.
A possibility to produce hydrogen offshore with no grid connection in the so-called “other energy 
generation sec- tors” (sonstige Energiegewinnungsbereiche, OES) was introduced in the law. The 
authorisation to install OWFs in these sectors will be conditional on an award in a tendering 
procedure, which is yet to be proposed and adopted [86]. According to the latest area development 
plan, a single area in the North Sea – SEN-1 – is designated for this purpose (e.g. for offshore 
wind turbines and a power-to-gas facility) and there is the possibility of further areas for the 
longer term32 [40]. However, the area development plan has ruled out the possibility to connect 
SEN-1 to the shore by cable or pipeline. In this regard, it is evident that spatial planning, in 
terms of available areas for offshore hydrogen production and for the transport infrastructure, are 
regulatory insecurities that need to be considered. In the case of construction and operation of 
subsea interconnector cables and hydrogen pipelines, approvals with regard to mining aspects with 
the regulations on use of waters above the continental shelf, as well as the air space above these 
waters are required in accordance with the German Federal Mining Act. The option of a direct (mer- 
chant) cable for supply of a power-to-gas facility on land can be challenging from a legal 
perspective. Finally, plan- ning and construction in the territorial waters are subject to the 
planning regime established by the Offshore In- stallations Act and the regional planning procedure 
of the relevant federal state needs to be followed. A compre- hensive overview of applicable legal 
acts and procedures for planning and constructing offshore infrastructure is available in the 
report33 from the North Sea Wind Power Hub project.
The Netherlands vision for the large-scale application of hydrogen production (and use) was laid 
out in the gov- ernment strategy on hydrogen and states that apart from stimulating hydrogen, 
further and accelerated develop- ment of offshore wind energy is an important part of the country’s 
climate protection ambitions [50]. With regard to a power-to-gas facility regulation, there are 
uncertainties that need to be tackled – similar to those in Germany. Current gas definitions in the 
Netherlands do not include hydrogen, which has wider implications for the applica- tion of existing 
gas related regulation to power-to-gas facilities, e.g. with regard to the organisation of network

access and feed-in [76]. Furthermore, uncertainties exist with regard to the classification of the 
power-to-gas facil- ity as end or wholesale electricity consumer, relevant for obligations to pay 
electricity network rates, taxes and levies [ibid].
An offshore wind market in the Netherlands is also well-established and the regulatory framework is 
stipulated through the Offshore Wind Energy Roadmap, the Climate Agreement, Wind Farm Site 
Decisions and permits issued under the Offshore Wind Energy Act, the Stimulation of Sustainable 
Energy Production Decision (for subsidies, if necessary) and the Development Framework for the 
development of offshore wind energy [29]. The Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO) is commissioned 
by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy for the develop- ment of areas in the Dutch 
North Sea EEZ. A comprehensive overview of applicable legal acts and procedures for planning and 
constructing offshore infrastructure is available in the report34 from the North Sea Wind Power Hub 
project.
A regulatory framework for offshore hydrogen production is currently lacking, but announcements and 
discussions on necessary adjustments are ongoing. Among others, it has been announced35 that a 
revision and integration of the 1998 Electricity Act and the Gas Act into a new Energy Act should 
allow offshore mining platforms to be con- nected to the grid. It is also envisaged that a review 
of the need for an adaptation of the applicable law concerning offshore grids, in consideration of 
any direct connections to the grid for industrial customers, conversion installa- tions (e.g. 
power-to-gas), oil and gas platforms (electrification) and CCS installations, will take shape 
within the framework of the legislative agenda. An updated overview on technical possibilities and 
economic opportunities for increasing the sustainability of energy supply from the North Sea in the 
period 2030–2050, the North Sea Energy Outlook36, is presented in a recent publication. In the 
associated letter, the Minister, among others, concludes that large-scale onshore electrolysis 
combined with offshore wind energy is achievable by 2030. Furthermore, it was announced that 
several models for joint tenders for offshore wind energy and hydrogen production are being as- 
sessed.

6.5.2.  Legal definition and certification of green hydrogen
There is currently no clear legal definition of green hydrogen on EU and national level. This, 
however, is a necessary prerequisite for its large-scale deployment. In Germany, the current 
definition of hydrogen as “biogas” if it was produced via electrolysis using “predominantly” 
renewable electricity will be adjusted [87]. Instead it will be de- fined as an energy carrier, as 
proposed in amendments of the Energy Industry Law from January 2021 [88]. In the Netherlands, 
hydrogen is not considered a gas under the definitions of the Dutch Gas Law.
An additional prerequisite for a functioning national and international large-scale market of green 
and low carbon hydrogen is the establishment of a certification system. Such a system should make 
it possible for producers to be able to demonstrate the origin of the energy used to produce the 
renewable hydrogen regardless of the location.

It is important to provide a distinction to consumers between low-carbon and green hydrogen and 
hydrogen pro- duced through more carbon intensive pathways and to allow monetisation of renewable 
quality of hydrogen. There is an established system of guarantees-of-origin (GO) certificates for 
electricity, stipulated by the Renewable Energy Directive [89]. The issuance, trade and cancelation 
of certificates are standardised through the European Energy Certificate System (EECS), which is 
organised by the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB). However, there is no such standardised 
European system for renewable gases and Member Countries have various national systems that are 
only partly interconnected and are based on voluntary agreements [90]. Furthermore, in the case of 
elec- tricity, there is no connection between the physical trade of the underlying commodity and 
the certificate trade, while the systems in the gas market rely on the mass-balancing approach 
coupled to the physical flows of the underlying energy commodity [ibid.]. As the current renewable 
gas certification systems were designed with regard to deployment of biogas for electricity 
production and production of biomethane to be fed into the natural gas grid, they are not suitable 
for the future green hydrogen market. Although provisions37 of the Renewable Energy Directive allow 
the possibility for hydrogen GOs, they contain no technical provisions regarding the nature of a 
possible hydrogen GO certificate and they will need to be significantly revised and updated to 
introduce hydrogen- specific GOs [91]. The EU hydrogen strategy announces EU-wide instruments that 
would, among others, include common comprehensive terminology and European-wide criteria for the 
certification of renewable and low-car- bon hydrogen. It notes that the specific, complementary 
functions that GOs and sustainability certificates already play in the Renewable Energy Directive 
can facilitate the most cost-effective production and EU-wide trading.
In that respect, the implementation of the of the revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) and 
accompanying technical rules envisaged for July 2021 will be a crucial step in addressing the 
regulatory uncertainty of green hy- drogen definition and certification on EU level [92].

6.5.3.  Hydrogen pipelines and underground storage
Hydrogen transport and storage concepts taken into account in this study (see Section 5.1) include 
hydrogen pipe- lines and underground storage infrastructure (specifically in salt caverns) in the 
Netherlands and north-west Ger- many. Cross-border pipelines are a necessary part of the supply and 
delivery route.
There are no substance-specific rules for hydrogen transportation at European level specifically. 
European regula- tions regarding hydrogen transport are application-specific, such as the 
directives on pressure equipment (2014/68/EU) and equipment for potentially explosive areas (ATEX 
94/9). Both Germany and the Netherlands have already developed 100% hydrogen pipelines under 
current regulations. These are currently point-to-point pipe- lines, and more extensive 
developments of the pipeline network would be required in order to form a hydrogen grid.
There are three operating hydrogen pipelines in Germany run by Air Liquide (240 km long in the 
Rhine-Ruhr area), by Heide Refinery (30 km long in Heide) and by Linde (100 km long, in Leuna) 
[95]. In the Netherlands, there are





³⁷ Article 19(7) (b)

91 / 146
29.03.2022







two hydrogen networks operated by Air Liquide and Air Products. Air Liquide operates the largest 
hydrogen net- work, with over 1,000 km, connecting hydrogen producers and consumers in France, 
Belgium and the Netherlands. These networks are designed specifically to the bilateral contracts of 
these parties [96].
One example in the Netherlands of potentially prohibitive legislation is that hydrogen transport is 
currently clas- sified as chemical piping and therefore falls into a different module within the 
Dutch “External Safety Pipelines Decree” in comparison to natural gas. This classification means 
that hydrogen falls into a higher risk category38. The current regulation therefore advises to have 
calculations carried out to quantify the risk, taking into account the difference in consequences 
of natural gas and hydrogen outflow. These regulatory aspects must be resolved before a large-scale 
use of hydrogen can replace natural gas in the Netherlands39 [94].
Hydrogen production, transportation and end use are likely to become more decoupled (forming grids 
rather than point-to-point pipelines) in the long-term. For the development of a large 
commercial-scale hydrogen gas network (with numerous hydrogen sources utilising the same network), 
more explicit hydrogen regulations are required at both national and European level, similar to 
those already developed for natural gas. The 2021 White Paper by ACER and CEER highlights that 
these existing business-to-business pipelines should not be impacted by future regulation regarding 
hydrogen networks [78]. They recommend that the regulatory framework should be clarified from the 
outset for private hydrogen networks that are constructed as business-to-business networks and that 
temporary exemptions to future regulation may be explicitly foreseen in the forthcoming EU legal 
framework. This will avoid that point-to-point pipelines are unnecessarily impacted, while ensuring 
that those exemptions are given under the same EU regulatory framework.

Reuse of natural gas pipelines
The proposed Hy3 hydrogen backbone pipeline network (as described in Section 5.2) is largely based 
on existing natural gas pipeline corridors and infrastructure. The current regulatory framework 
surrounding the reuse of ex- isting natural gas pipelines will therefore play a major role in the 
establishment of hydrogen supply chains as pre- sumed in this study.
There are no cases of the reuse of natural gas pipelines for use with pure hydrogen in Germany to 
date, but inten- sive activities are being carried out in this regard. Gas transmission system 
operators have already proposed a concept for integrating green gas40 pipelines as a part of a 
network development plan [97]. The proposed pure hydrogen network envisages 471 km of pipelines by 
2025 – consisting of 83% repurposed gas infrastructure – and 1,236 km by 2030 – consisting of 88% 
repurposed gas infrastructure [ibid.]. To allow the development of such a hydrogen backbone, a 
necessary regulatory framework is still to be established. In this regard, a recent proposal of 
amendments to the Energy Industry Act includes a transitional regulation on the regulatory 
treatment of pure hydrogen networks that aims to set a framework for a speedy and legally secure 
start to the gradual development of a national hydrogen network infrastructure [97]. Furthermore, 
the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) accepted


³⁸ This is mainly due to there being less long-term experience handling hydrogen pipelines, which 
impacts the statistical risk analysis.
³⁹ DNV GL and The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs undertook an assessment of current hydrogen 
infrastructure in the Netherlands, which included a review of regulatory aspects regarding the 
potential to add hydrogen to the existing gas system.

operators’ 2020–2030 grid development plan with several requests for changes, allowing the 
pipelines to be taken out of the current natural gas infrastructure and added to a future hydrogen 
grid, provided that the performance of the current gas grid is left uncompromised [98].
The reuse of natural gas pipelines for the transportation of hydrogen has been permitted in the 
Netherlands under current regulations. A previously state-owned (Gasunie) 12 km long natural gas 
pipeline has been repurposed for hydrogen transportation (from Dow to Yara), transporting four 
kilotons of hydrogen per year. The pipeline is now operated privately by Gasunie New Energy rather 
than Gasunie because hydrogen is not considered a gas under the definitions of the Dutch Gas Law, 
thus preventing the hydrogen pipeline from being operated as part of the regulated activities of 
gas system operators [100]. The Dutch government is currently investigating the role Gasunie will 
have in the future hydrogen supply chain [99]. For more commercial large-scale developments, 
hydrogen spe- cific standards and regulations would be beneficial in an effort to provide clarity 
on the differences between oper- ating natural gas and hydrogen within a repurposed pipeline. 
Gasunie recently provided feedback on the EC’s “Hy- drogen and Gas Markets Decarbonisation 
Package”, stating (regarding hydrogen transmission) that several issues still need to be clarified 
[101]. Firstly, that in certain cases an (administrative) transfer of assets within companies will 
be needed to ensure maximal efficiency between shared services (i.e. between the natural gas and 
hydrogen operations within the infrastructure operator). A second issue that needs to be addressed 
is ensuring the rights of way that need to remain applicable after repurposing infrastructure from 
natural gas to hydrogen.
The European Commission is expected to propose a new legislative package containing more widespread 
reforms for the gas sector in Q4 of 2021. This gas decarbonisation package is expected to revise 
the gas market design and enforce renewable gases’ role in the European market.

Cross-border pipeline transport
The requirements for a transitional pipeline between Germany and the Netherlands would be defined 
under na- tional laws and regulatory requirements, given the lack of hydrogen-specific pipeline 
regulation at European level. For the onshore pipeline transportation of hydrogen the gas 
composition standards and operational regulations would currently be regulated at national level. 
It would be more comprehensive and more conducive to future cross-border investments to implement 
uniform standards and common principles in place at European level through which national standards 
and therefore projects can be guided. Otherwise, varying regulations at national level require the 
project investor to comply with multiple regulatory requirements [99].
The EU policy framework does however provide enabling measures and co-funding (e.g. TEN-E and CEF 
funding) to develop investment in gas infrastructure that will have a cross-border impact. A 
proposal for revisions to the TEN-E regulations was published in December 2020, which has an 
increased focus on low carbon gases, including hydrogen. To support the decarbonisation needs of 
the hard-to-abate sectors, the revisions proposed will include “dedicated new and repurposed 
hydrogen networks with cross-border relevance (including hydrogen transmission pipelines and 
related equipment such as compressors, storage facilities and facilities for liquefied hydrogen) 
and power-to-gas facilities above a certain threshold with cross-border relevance (i.e. aiming to 
supply at least two Mem- ber States)” [98]. Hydrogen networks will also be appropriately reflected 
in the EU-wide Ten-year Network Devel- opment Plans (TYNDPs) prepared by the European Network of 
Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG). The projects of common interest (PCIs) are selected 
from the most recent TYNDP via a separate process led by the

93 / 146
29.03.2022







European Commission, hence these revisions to the TEN-E will open up further potential funding 
sources for cross- border hydrogen infrastructure projects. In this respect and with a view on the 
next TYNDP 2022, ENTSOG confirms that their model “is fit for hybrid network assessment where both 
methane and hydrogen coexist, according to the three pathways identified in the ENTSOG Roadmap 
(methane, blending and hydrogen), and that the relevant pro- jects can be assessed” [102]. 
Furthermore, cross-border pipelines are already envisaged by transmission system operator’s visions 
(see Section 6.4), but the necessary regulatory provisions are still lacking.
To conclude, cross-border hydrogen transport by pipelines between the Netherlands and Germany is 
still bur- dened by substantial regulatory uncertainties that have to be resolved on EU and 
national levels in a coordinated manner.

Underground hydrogen storage
Hydrogen storage falls under generic underground gas storage regulatory frameworks at European 
level. There are no regulatory frameworks specifically for hydrogen.
Underground hydrogen storage in the Netherlands is not currently being pursued. The Dutch Mining 
Act (“Mijnbouwwet”) outlines the requirements regarding the storage of substances in the 
undergrounds (if greater than 500 m in depth) but has no specific requirements and references 
regarding hydrogen. The use of subsurface reservoirs for gas storage and as temporary buffers for 
various gases is therefore possible within Dutch Law, in- cluding the storage of hydrogen. A study 
into large-scale energy storage in the Netherlands has recently been con- ducted by TNO, which 
highlighted that the permit process for such projects is currently complex and long [103. The study 
concluded that more experience in such projects will help allow for the development of a more 
effective decision-making process. Underground gas storage has already been undertaken in the 
Netherlands, including natural gas storage in salt caverns in Zuidwending, natural gas storage in 
depleted gas fields in Norg, Grijpskerk, Bergermeer and Alkmaar, and nitrogen storage in salt 
caverns in Heiligerlee. It should be noted regarding aquifer storage specifically that, although 
technically possible, the current legal guidelines (in particular the Mining Act and Mining 
Regulation) have been highlighted as potentially prohibitive as they currently offer few 
possibilities relating to accommodating the necessary pressure increases [104].
In Germany, underground storage of hydrogen has been undertaken, for example, at the Ketzin site 
(aquifer stor- age) and the Kiel site (salt cavern storage), but in the form of town gas (62% 
hydrogen) [105]. Pure hydrogen storage in Germany has not yet reached commercial scales. 
Underground gas storage falls under the Federal Mining Act (BBergG) and is permitted under current 
regulation although hydrogen is not mentioned explicitly.
There are currently no regulatory barriers to storing hydrogen underground in Dutch and German 
national laws, but more explicit requirements are needed.

6.5.4.  Conclusions and recommendations for a regulatory framework
Enabling hydrogen supply chains, as described and analysed in the study, would require various 
adjustments of regulatory frameworks both on EU and national levels. The proposed infrastructure 
configurations for hydrogen production along the North Sea of the Netherlands and Germany are only 
possible if rapid and massive scale-up of offshore wind capacities is coupled with onshore and 
offshore deployment of power-to-gas technology. The

major regulatory gaps and uncertainties currently include the legal status of power-to-gas 
facilities as part of wider sector-coupling concepts. Regarding hydrogen production, the barrier 
for large-scale electrolysis deployment in Germany is due to a surcharge obligation on the 
electricity used, but this is being tackled and legal adjustments are ongoing. Furthermore, rules 
for legal definition and certification of green hydrogen in both countries need to be established 
and enforced, which is expected to be addressed on EU level in the short term. To allow system- 
wide optimisation the EU framework will need to address an issue of electrolysers locations (e.g. 
through targets, priority areas or incentive schemes) to ensure that they are planned and built at 
sites where large potentials of renewable energies and storage capacities are available. The 
regulatory framework for the offshore wind market in both countries is established, but the role of 
large-scale onshore and offshore hydrogen production from off- shore wind is yet to be considered 
and developed. In Germany, a pilot area for “other energy generation” is planned and will provide 
an opportunity for initial deployment of an offshore hydrogen production and could serve as a 
valuable lesson. Regarding the transport and storage of hydrogen (via pipelines and in geological 
formations), it should be noted that although there are no regulations in place that are 
preventative, substantial gaps and uncer- tainties exist in current regulations. In this respect, 
an ongoing process of developing an enabling regulatory frame- work at EU level will steer further 
development, but interim measures are needed to allow timely preparation and planning of national 
and cross-border hydrogen backbone realisation. An initial proposal of such measures has been 
published in Germany. In any case, close cross-border cooperation is desired, to meet the needs for 
transna- tional transport and storage of hydrogen.
The main messages and recommendations regarding the regulatory framework are as follows:
1.  The rapid and massive scale-up of offshore wind-to-green hydrogen production capacities in the 
Neth- erlands and Germany will only be possible with further development and specification of the 
enabling rules. In particular, developments are required to allow for:
▪  The spatial planning of large-scale offshore power-to-gas deployment, including necessary 
connection of infrastructure in both countries (already in progress in Germany)
▪  The tendering and market design for offshore wind energy and hydrogen production in both 
countries
▪  The legal classification, development and management regulation of power-to-gas facilities in 
both coun- tries
▪  The avoidance of distortive taxes and levies by finalisation and implementation of announced 
measures in Germany
▪  A legal definition and certification of green and other types of low-carbon hydrogen (e.g. via 
guarantees- of-origin certificates) in both countries
▪  Cross-border offshore projects, including offshore hydrogen projects (e.g. through realisation 
of the North Sea Energy Cooperation)

2.  Establishing a transnational cross-border hydrogen market between the Netherland and Germany 
(in- cluding the North Rhine-Westphalia region) via hydrogen pipelines and storage infrastructure, 
mainly from repurposed gas infrastructure, is facing regulatory uncertainties that need to be 
tackled. In par- ticular, the areas that need increased regulatory clarity include:

▪  Safe hydrogen transport via pipeline, by reconsidering the current classification of hydrogen as 
a chemical in the Netherlands
▪  The regulatory framework for the development, management and access to repurposed and new hydro- 
gen pipelines and storages. Since the EU rules are envisaged in the short to medium-term, 
transitional measures on national level (already proposed in Germany) are necessary for a timely 
planning and reali- sation of the hydrogen backbone
▪  Coordinated cross-border planning and development of the future hydrogen pipelines and storages 
in view of TEN-E proposals, TYNDP for gas, and the national network planning processes

A. Appendix: Demand scenarios

A1 Description of methodology
The energy system model FINE-NESTOR (National Energy System Model with Sector Coupling) is the 
model applied to derive the scenario for hydrogen demand. The model maps the national energy supply 
from primary energy supply to the conversion sector, through to the end-use sectors. The sectors 
are represented in the form of tech- nologies or process chains and linked via energy flows. The 
technologies are characterised in terms of energy, emissions and costs. The model is designed as a 
closed optimisation model with the objective function of the min- imisation of total system costs. 
Investment decisions to reach a cost-efficient transition are modelled from the macroeconomic and 
not from the microeconomic perspective. Therefore, the results do not reflect the decisions of 
individual market participants, but rather show an idealised picture where all costs in the system 
are internal- ised during the decision-making process. Furthermore, the results are subject to 
uncertainties related to technol- ogy development in the future, as projections for 
technology-related and economic parameters, such as invest- ment costs and efficiencies, were 
applied in the assessment. Since the model represents only part of the national economy, it is a 
partial equilibrium model. Given a CO2 mitigation path, the FINE-NESTOR model can be used to 
calculate the cost-optimal transformation strategy for the entire energy system required to reach 
the CO2 emis- sions reduction targets.
In order to be able to represent the fluctuating feed-in of renewable energy and its effects in a 
problem-oriented manner, the model has a temporal resolution in the hourly range. Particularly 
against the background of the in- creasing importance of sector coupling, a special advantage of 
the model approach is that all interactions of the energy system can be consistently taken into 
account. The model also uses a methodological approach that al- lows for cost uncertainties to be 
adequately addressed (see Lopion et al. [21]). Drivers of the model are energy 
consumption-determining demands (e.g. population development, gross value added, goods demands, 
transport demands, etc.), which are exogenously specified and are not part of the optimisation. The 
model is based on a myopic approach, i.e. on an approach that successively minimises the respective 
costs for the respec- tive time intervals. To determine the transformation strategy, a back-casting 
method is used in a first step. It is based on the concept of first optimising the energy system of 
the target year as freely as possible and, based on the result, defining upper and lower limits for 
the systems of the intermediate time intervals. Then, in a second step, the cost optimisation of 
the preceding intervals is carried out, analogously to a forecasting approach, within the set limit 
values.

B.Appendix: Production scenarios

B1 Wind potential assessment

Methodology and assumptions for offshore WT
Existing wind turbines and assumptions on technological development of wind turbine generators 
(WTGs) are used as input data for a physical model when modelling generation time series. WTG 
technology parameters41 are taken into account and their expected development is shown in Figure 
49.




















Figure 49: Technology assumptions for the modelling of the performance time series of wind turbines 
(own analysis)

Approach and assumptions of the analysis
▪  Nominal power: It is assumed that the average nominal output of the turbines will increase to 20 
MW by 2050. The increase in nominal power is mainly driven by improved cost efficiency of large 
turbines. The third interim report on the area development plan assumes a nominal capacity of 15 MW 
by 2030 [32].
▪  Specific rated power: The specific rated output – i.e. the generator output per m² of rotor area 
– is on av- erage approx. 370 W/m² for the offshore wind turbines built in the first half of 2020. 
According to industry surveys, only minor changes in the range between 350 and 400 W/m² are 
expected in the medium to long term [32]. Furthermore, the area development plan [26] assumes 400 
W/m². Therefore, this value is taken into account in the modelling and assumed to be constant over 
time. A lower specific rated output leads on the one hand to higher space requirements and higher 
specific investment costs of the WTGs, but on


⁴¹ Parameters represent the average values of the WTGs built in the respective year. The maximum 
values as a reflection of the state of the art would be more extreme.

the other hand also to higher capacity utilisation and thus higher energy yields in relation to the 
installed capacity.

Rotor diameter: The development of the rotor diameter results mathematically from the assumptions 
regarding the nominal power and the specific area output of the turbines. It is derived from the 
assumptions described above.
▪  Hub heights: Due to the low surface roughness of the water surface and the resulting steep wind 
profile, higher hub height results in a comparatively small increase in yield compared to WTGs on 
land, so that for economic reasons the tower height is limited to what is required for the rotors. 
However, an increase in hub height can be expected as a consequence of the increase in rotor 
diameter. In order to ensure a con- stant distance of the rotor blade tip to the water surface of 
approx. 30 m, the hub height must increase with increasing nominal power (while maintaining the 
same specific power rating). The development of the hub height is therefore derived mathematically 
from the assumptions of the nominal power and the specific area output, analogous to the 
development of the rotor diameter.


Assumptions for installation density
▪  When determining the installable capacity on a given area, a distinction is made between a 
nominal and a corrected power density [26]. The nominal power density results from the installed 
capacity and the size of the enveloping areas. For the determination of the corrected power 
density, a buffering or enlargement of the individual areas has to be carried out in the first 
step. This expansion of the area should reflect the required (half) minimum distance between two 
WTGs. With a minimum distance of five rotor diameters between individual WTGs, the wind farm area 
would have to be buffered with 2.5 rotor diameters. The quotient of the nominal power of a wind 
farm and the corrected (buffered) area results in the corrected power density. This value is a more 
comparable parameter, since distortions due to the size and shape of the individual areas are not 
as significant with this method. In the study, a buffer of 2.8 rotor diameters was applied while 
assuming an average rotor diameter of 220 m resulting in a buffer size of 616 m.
▪  Corrected power density of 8 to 10 MW/km² was applied for the German North Sea, depending on the 
location as described in [26]. For zone 1 and zone 2, a higher corrected power density of 9.5 to 10 
MW/km² is assumed, while offshore wind farms in zones 3 to 5 are modelled with a corrected power 
density of 8 MW/km². This lower power density is justified on the one hand by larger connected 
areas and on the other hand by restrictions due to grid connection.
▪  Power density of existing wind farms in the Netherlands is currently rather low, which may 
partly be due to their location in the English Channel with a less advantageous wind resource. 
Furthermore, space for offshore WTGs in relation to domestic electricity demand is less limited in 
the Netherlands, allowing a lower power density for WTG installations. For the given reasons, a 
corrected power density of 6.0 MW/km² was applied. Similar assumptions were made in PBL Netherlands 
Environmental Assessment Agency (2018) [28]. The corrected value of 6.0 MW/km² corresponds to an 
average nominal power density of 6.9 MW/km².

Assumptions for wind farm shading (wake losses)
▪  A wind turbine extracts energy from moving air masses. This energy is restored by vertical 
energy transport from the above air layers. However, due to low turbulences in the wind field above 
the sea, this restoration happens rather slowly in comparison to typical onshore situations. 
Therefore, wake effects in offshore wind farms are more pronounced in comparison to onshore wind 
farms and greater distances between wind turbines are required.
▪  The wind farm shading is taken into account by using an empirically derived, wind speed 
dependent shad- ing curve. Results from different research groups (i.e. Fraunhofer IWES modelling 
of wake losses for the FEP scenario within the X-Wakes research project) on the reassessment of the 
offshore wind potential in the German North Sea provides guidance but a realistic estimation of the 
yield reduction due to cross- farm shading effects in the case of a large-scale expansion of 
offshore wind energy in the North Sea region is yet to be carried out.

Assumptions for area availability in the German North Sea
▪  The reserved and priority areas provided by the Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) 
in the draft of the spatial development plan as of 19 Sept. 2020 [27]: This scenario accounts for 
the political tar- gets of the German government aiming for 20 GW offshore capacity in 2020 and 40 
GW in 2040. As suitable areas in the Baltic Sea are very limited, most of the development will 
happen in the German North Sea.
▪  “Sonstige Energiegewinnungsbereiche Nordsee” (SEN) areas: These areas were declared specified 
areas for non-grid connected energy generation in the draft of the spatial development plan [26].
▪  Additional areas in the shipping lane SN10: However, these areas are assumed to be built last, 
as it is quite uncertain whether these areas will become available.
▪  All other areas will be repowered after 25 years, resulting in the installation of more modern 
WTGs. Excep- tionally, repowering of wind farms in areas with high populations of harbour porpoises 
and loons will not be possible.42
▪  The German North Sea EEZ covers approx. 28,521 km² [31]. Of this area, 6,123 km² have been 
identified for the construction of offshore wind farms. However, 267 km² of currently identified 
areas are located in protected zones (no repowering – see above). Another 10 km² are located in 
existing areas within the 12 nautical mile zone, which are also not considered for repowering. 
Further 1,253 km² of areas for offshore use are within the shipping lane SN10 and are not part of 
the latest draft of the spatial development plan
[27] but were identified as possible areas for offshore use in the conception B of the preliminary 
draft of the area development plan [26]. Correspondingly, 4,593 km² are with high probability 
available for the installation of offshore wind turbines.





⁴² Wind turbines in these farms will be decommissioned at the end of their lifetime, which is 
assumed to be 25 years after deployment.

Original and smoothed (normalised) power curve
A smoothed power curve is generated by means of Gaussian smoothing, which better reflects the 
operating be- haviour of a wind farm, taking into account the spatially and temporally averaged 
wind speed data rather than the direct use of the power curve.

LCOE model
A cost model is applied to evaluate the development sequence of yet unscheduled wind farms. The 
cost model calculates the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) as a function of yield, water depth 
and distance from shore. The investment costs (CAPEX) are derived from two similar cost models 
[106, 107], which are adapted to the specific water depth. The operating costs (OPEX) are 
determined similarly, but they only depend on the distance to the coast. For calculating LCOE, 
energy yield is modelled based on a standard WTGs and the meteorological year 2012. The areas are 
then selected starting from the lowest LCOE until the desired capacity is reached [34].
The calculation of CAPEX and OPEX for offshore wind turbines is based on Härtel et al. 2018. The 
correction fac- tors taking into account the water depth and the distance to the shore as well as 
the installation year have been calculated as follows.43

































⁴³ The correction factor for CAPEX and OPEX for the year of construction was changed from the 
former reference year 2014 to the new refer- ence year 2020.


118 / 146
29.03.2022







▪  The correction factor for CAPEX and OPEX for the year of construction was changed from the 
former ref- erence year 2014 to the new reference year 2020.
▪  The CAPEX per kW depending on the distance to shore (see figures above) and depending on the 
founda- tion depth (see figures above) have been transformed into correction factors. The 
referenced distance to the shore is 20 km, and the referenced foundation depth is 20 m (correction 
factor for distance to the shore (20 km) = 1, correction factor for water depth (20 m) = 1).
▪  The values for OPEX per kW depending on the distance to shore (see figures above ) were also 
recalculated using a correction factor referencing to 20 km distance to shore (correction factor 
for distance to the shore (20 km) = 1).
▪  Correction factors for CAPEX and OPEX for the distance to shore and the foundation depth were 
calculated for each wind farm.
▪  The CAPEX for a wind farm is determined by multiplying the capacity built in year X with the 
reference value for CAPEX per installed kilowatt (2,000 EUR/kW) and the correction factors for 
distance to shore, foundation depth and year of construction for the same reference year X.
▪  The average CAPEX of a cluster/zone is weighted proportionally to the cluster’s/zone’s overall 
installation volume in the reference year.
▪  The OPEX of a wind farm is calculated by multiplying the capacity built in year X with the 
reference value for OPEX per installed kilowatt (€65/kW*a), the correction factor for the distance 
to shore and the correc- tion factor for the year of construction for the same reference year X.
▪  The average OPEX of a cluster/zone is weighted proportionally to the cluster’s/zone’s overall 
installation volume in the reference year.

The LCOE calculation is based on the annuity method described in (Verein deutscher Ingenieure VDI 
2012a) and (Verein deutscher Ingenieure VDI 2012b). The table below shows which annuities have been 
included as cost components in the calculation of the LCOE model for the different scenarios.



Scenario A1 and A2
▪ Wind farm
▪ Platforms for the offshore converters
▪ Offshore converters
▪ Cables and onshore converters
Scenario B1
▪ Wind farm
▪ Cables for connecting the wind farm to the offshore electrolysis platform
Scenario B2
▪ Wind farm
▪ Platforms for the converters*
▪ Offshore converters*
▪ Cables*
*only for the additional power connection to the shore


The annuities are then divided by the produced electricity. For this the following equation was 
used:

B2 Hydrogen production potential assessment

Methodology and assumptions for hydrogen production scenarios
Scenario  Assumptions and methodology
▪ Only power that cannot be integrated into the grid is used for electrolysis. This leads to the 
smallest full-load hours of all scenarios.
▪ Full-load hours of the electrolyser in Germany vary between 890 and 2,456 hours, depending A1     
  on the assumed grid capacity in each reference year. The full-load hours of the electrolyser
vary between 1,876 and 2,478 h, depending on the assumed grid capacity in each reference year. The 
duration curves are presented in Section 3.3 for each reference year.
▪ A fixed ratio of the generated energy is fed into the electrolysis process, based on an eco- 
nomic optimisation (ratio of the electrolyser capacity to the maximum wind production is calculated 
for every reference year). This leads to a lower electrolyser capacity (than A1) and thus to an 
increase in full-load hours.
▪ Hydrogen production follows electricity generation. To achieve this, it is necessary to assume 
both grid expansion and electrolyser development. The duration curves are presented in Fig- ure 
51–Figure 54 for each reference year. The resulting electrolyser deployment roadmap is described in 
Section 4.3.1
▪ All the electricity generated from the wind farms in zones 4 & 5 of the German EEZ and clus- ters 
3, 4 & 5 in the Dutch EEZ is directly fed into the electrolyser. In case of Netherlands, Gro- 
ningen is the hydrogen feed-in point for clusters 4 & 5 and Rotterdam is the hydrogen feed-in point 
for cluster 3.
▪ Offshore electrolyser is designed for 95% of the maximum wind production. Surplus energy is 
curtailed, but that is only about 1–2% of the total energy depending on the respective cluster or 
zones.
▪ Pilot zone SEN-1 (Germany) is part of EN 8 in zone 3, but it is planned to use this area as a pi- 
lot area for offshore hydrogen production and therefore to install an offshore electrolyser in this 
area.
▪ Deployment of electrolyser capacity for scenario B2 is based on similar assumptions as in 
scenario B1. In contrast to scenario B1, additional electricity grid connections of 2 GW per
B2     zone or cluster are installed for technical reasons (for grid stability and support). The 
electro- lyser capacity is calculated by reducing the maximum power output of the considered wind 
farms by the installed grid capacity.

Assumptions for calculation of CAPEX and OPEX
Fraunhofer IEE used a cost curve model to calculate the PEM electrolyser costs taking into account 
data from:

▪  International Energy Agency (IEA) 2019
▪  Smolinka et al. 2018
▪  Bertuccioli et al. 2014
▪  van ’t Noordende und Ripson 2020
▪  Bazzanella und Ausfelder 2017













The correction factors taking into account the water depth and the distance to the shore as well as 
the installation year have been calculated as follows:





























129 / 146

Cost assumptions for hydrogen production cost assessment
The total CAPEX for the entire lifetime of 25 years, for example, has been calculated by adding 
together an initial hardware cost for the system including above mentioned components and a stack 
replacement44 cost in accord- ance with the stack lifetime in equivalent full-load operating hours 
and taking into account the residual value equivalent to the remaining lifetime of the stack.
In this respect, redesign of the cooling system and other components was assumed by adding 5% of 
CAPEX as well as another 5% of CAPEX for extended service life of critical parts (i.e. filters, 
etc.) in order to minimise service re- quirements and maximise service intervals. Such 
modifications are necessary for a safe and reliable operation of offshore installations to increase 
their technical availability and reduce service requirements. For offshore elec- trolysis, an 
additional cost item for seawater desalination is used as a fixed amount45 for all scales and 
years. Fur- thermore, an important additional cost item for the offshore electrolysis is the 
platform required for the installa- tion of the electrolysis. Here, the cost model developed in 
(Dambeck et al. 2020b) has been used. The footprint of the platform is equal to 4m²/MW of 
electrolysis capacity, which means that a 40x60 m² platform provides space for 600 MW of 
electrolysis capacity. The total platform cost is calculated as a function of wind power.
The financing cost parameters for LCOE and LCOH are identical. The observation period (project time 
span) is 25 years, the interest rate amounts to 5% and the cost escalation rate is 1.455%, which is 
the average inflation rate of Germany taking into account the last 20 years (Statistische Bundesamt 
(Destatis) 2020).

44 Stack costs are set at 60% of the electrolyser hardware CAPEX. In this approach, an average 
efficiency is applied throughout the entire stack lifetime assuming a linear degradation.

⁴⁶ The interest rate for the calculations is assumed to be 5%, taking into account numbers from 
Dambeck et al. 2020a, Kost et al. 2018, Schyska und Kies 2020, Steffen 2020 and Hobohm et al. 2013. 
Values vary depending on the considered country and the year of construction. Increasing project 
experience reduces risk premiums and lowers financing costs for offshore wind and electrolysis in 
the long term. In order not to include an additional variable, a plausible average interest rate 
for the next 30 years was chosen.

C. Appendix: Transport scenarios

C1 Technical challenges of infrastructure modifications
Technically, numerous processes and mechanisms could occur depending on the type/condition of steel 
and hy- drogen conditions (Robertson et al., 2015). A common starting point is hydrogen diffusion 
into the steel, which could eventually weaken steel strength and/or cause cracking (Huising & Krom, 
2020; Krom, 2020; Trouvé et al., 2019). Hydrogen molecule catalysis by steel produces atomic 
hydrogen. Diffusion of atomic hydrogen into steel is an essential step in the embrittlement 
process. Upon diffusion into steel grain lattice, atomic hydrogen can in- duce decohesion by 
weakening the molecular bonds within steel. These weak bonds lead to dislocation, which in 
combination with other potential defects leads to plasticity and eventually failing under stress. 
An effective rate of hydrogen crack growth also depends on the pressure and temperature. In a 
recent workshop (Krom, 2020), Gasunie presented lab experiments concluding that crack growth is 
less than 0.022 mm over a 100-year period with 6.6 bar daily pressure cycle for an assumed defect 
in pipe welding. This growth rate is not projected to pose integrity risks for 100% hydrogen at 66 
bar.
Presence of coatings (such as an oxide layer inside pipelines) could provide barrier for 
embrittlement as catalysis and diffusion of atomic hydrogen is the first step in embrittlement. 
Addition of O2, CO2, or CO molecules to the hydrogen could also have an inhibiting effect on 
embrittlement (Staykov et al., 2014). These solutions to reduce the effect of hydrogen on steel are 
being investigated in the Hydelta project (Hydelta, 2020).

C2 Network topology
The hydrogen transport network described in Section 5.2.1 is represented by a series of nodes and 
edges/connec- tions. The nodes consist of demand, supply, import and storage location. The 
edges/connections consist of pipe segments identified by a unique pipe ID. Each pipe segment is 
represented by the number of lines, nominal pipe size (inches) and its hydrogen transport capacity 
(metric tons/hr). For reference, Figure 58 shows the network to- pology with the number of lines 
and the pipe ID. Note that the pipe ID is unique within each network topology, but not universally 
unique. That means that pipe ID 1 for the “default” network is not the same as pipe ID 1 in 
‘WithRotterdamDEpipe’ network. The data is also listed in the tables below.

C3 Transport analysis network model
The model that has been applied in this study consists of a network flow solver that balances 
hydrogen flow in an interconnected network of nodes and edges. A node is a specific geographic 
location where hydrogen is either removed from or added to the network. An edge is a connection 
between two nodes. For example, nodes repre- sent supply, demand, storage and import locations on a 
map, whereas edges represent the hydrogen transport grid (see Figure 35). In a network, multiple 
solutions could lead to a balanced grid operation. Therefore, we use the flow distance to quantify 
the effective distance over which hydrogen flows in the network. Flow distance 𝜙𝑖 is defined as 
the product of the length 𝑙𝑖 (km) and flow rate 𝑓𝑖 (metric tons/hr) of pipe segment 𝑖.
𝜙𝑖 = 𝑙𝑖 × 𝑓𝑖
The shortest transport route between supply and demand nodes could then be determined by minimizing 
the sum of all flow distances in the network. Mathematically, we translate this insight to the 
following objective func- tion 𝐽(𝑓𝑖)
𝐽(𝑓𝑖) = ∑ 𝜙𝑖
𝑖

This objective function is minimised by bounding the flow rates 𝑓𝑖 between 0 and maximum flow 
capacity of pipe segment 𝑖. Reverse flow was allowed in the network. Additionally, the following 
constraint is imposed on the minimisation problem: Net flow balance at each node 𝑗, at each time 
step 𝑘, 𝑁𝑘 is zero. That is, no flow is accu-
mulated at each node at each time step.
Net flow balance at each node 𝑁𝑗 is calculated from the difference between supply, import and 
storage in produc- tion mode and demand, export and storage in feed-in mode, and which effectively 
reads as:
𝑁𝑗 = In − Out
𝑁𝑗 = (𝑆𝑘 + 𝐼𝑘 + 𝑐𝑘) − (𝐷𝑘)
𝑗   𝑗   𝑗    𝑗
Here, 𝑆𝑘 is the hydrogen supply, 𝐷𝑘 is the hydrogen demand, 𝐼𝑘 is the hydrogen import at the 
port of Rotterdam
𝑗                 𝑗                 𝑗
(Netherlands) or the port of Wilhelmshaven (Germany) and 𝑐𝑘 is the hydrogen storage. Subscript 𝑗 
denotes node
and superscript 𝑘 denotes time step. The supply 𝑆𝑘 and demand 𝐷𝑘 as estimates in the network 
calculation are
𝑗         𝑗
based on the analysis in Sections 3 and 4. The import 𝐼𝑘 and storage 𝑐𝑘 values are based on the 
annual import
𝑗        𝑗

and storage needs as calculated in Section 5.4.1. We assumed a flat import rate over a given year. 
We also as- sumed an equal split between all the storage locations considered in specific scenario 
combination. Additionally,
we assumed that total storage rate for NL and NRW is equally split across the four storage sites in 
order to esti- mate 𝑐𝑘. For example, if at a certain moment in the year there is more supply 
(import + production) than de- mand, then the storages are filled with an equal rate for all 
storage sites. There is no optimal dispatch of storage
sites assumed across the network.
Annual Import = Annual demand - Annual supply
If import at the port of Rotterdam, 𝐼𝑘 (GWh/hr) = Annual Import (GWh) (where 𝑗 = NL_R)
𝑗          8760 (hr)

If import at the port of Rotterdam & the port of Wilhelmshaven,
𝐼𝑘 (GWh/hr) = 0.5 × Annual Import (GWh) (where 𝑗 = NL_R & DE_Em)
𝑗              8760 (hr)
The formulae above were used when demand is greater than supply. Naturally, in the situation where 
supply is greater than demand, then similar formulae could be used to calculate annual export.
In order to estimate the hydrogen storage capacity needed to accommodate fluctuations in one year, 
we calcu- lated the instantaneous hourly deficit/excess 𝑐𝑘 at hour 𝑘 as
𝑐𝑘 = ∑ 𝐷𝑘 − ∑ 𝑆𝑘
𝑗    𝑗
𝑗     𝑗
The model assumes all storage is split equally between all the four sites (that is, 𝑐𝑘 = 𝑐𝑘⁄4 
). The storage site charge, 𝐶𝑘 for entire network in a year containing 𝑘 hours could then be 
calculated as,
8760
𝐶𝑘 = ∑  𝑐𝑘
𝑘=1

Here, 𝐶𝑘 represents the storage site charge over a given year for the entire network consisting 
of four salt cavern sites. Figure 58 shows the annual storage site charge for a scenario in 2030 
and in 2050 as an example. The hydro- gen storage capacity required is then defined as
Storage capacity = max 𝐶𝑘 − min 𝐶𝑘
𝑘     𝑘


Annual import is estimated by assumed that at the end of a year. There is no net deficit or excess 
hydrogen pre- sent. See Figure 57 for an example.

C4 Transport scenarios

Year 2030
The flow in pipe segment between NL_R and NL_2 (pipe ID 35, network default) would be a sum of 
hydrogen pro- duced from electrolysis using electricity generated from offshore wind farm and the 
import of hydrogen from overseas at the port of Rotterdam. In Figure 60, we show the level of 
detailed flow profiles analysed with two ex- amples – P35 and P2.



































Figure 60: Plots showing annual flow profile for two pipe segments along with the normalised mean, 
min. & max. flow interval. (a) shows that the flow through P35 consists of supply and import at 
NL_R node. In (b), the normalised flow through P35 is shown along with the mean, min. & max. 
normalised flow. Similarly, (c) shows annual flow profile through P2 along with normalised profiles 
in (d).

Year 2035 – single line network
In this section we show the single line network simulations for 2035. We can see that the single 
line capacities would be insufficient to meet the transport needs projects for 2035 (see Figure 
62).
