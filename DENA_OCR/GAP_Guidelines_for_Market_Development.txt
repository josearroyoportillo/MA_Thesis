1  Executive Summary



Powerfuels are synthetic gaseous or liquid non-biofuels that draw their energy content from green 
electricity. They are renewable and climate-friendly and can be used as energy carri- ers and 
feedstocks. This understanding of powerfuels includes, but is not limited to, hydrogen, synthetic 
gas (e.g. methane, propane, ammonia) and synthetic liquid fuels (e.g. methanol, Fischer-Tropsch 
products) and is hence technologically neutral.

By transforming electrons into molecules, powerfuels enable renewable electricity to be stored over 
long periods and trans- ported over long distances. Technologies for production of powerfuels are 
proven and tested in many installations world- wide, but processes have not yet been scaled up to 
industrial- scale.

The Global Alliance Powerfuels was initiated with the strategic objective of fostering the 
development of a global market for powerfuels. The main goals are to raise awareness and accep- 
tance, to stimulate global project development and to enhance the regulatory framework to stimulate 
demand.

The following guideline paper presents the Alliance’s perspec- tive on the most important 
principles and instruments to foster global market development. Powerfuels can provide all sectors 
with low emission fuels. They thus will be vital towards achiev- ing the global goals on reducing 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emis- sions stated in the Paris Agreement on climate change.

Bearing in mind the important role of powerfuels for future en- ergy supply and the time required 
to penetrate markets with new technologies, policy makers have to start creating a new
global market framework today for the continuous market development of powerfuels. This will 
stimulate a new technolog- ical development with global benefits for sustainable fuel and feedstock 
supply, local employment and technological expertise.

To stimulate and foster the market development of powerfuels, the Global Alliance Powerfuels 
recommends to:

■  bring powerfuels as missing link for the reduction of global GHG emissions to the highest level 
of national and inter- national climate and energy debate between politicians and business leaders;
■  develop a consistent, long-term GHG emission policy with instruments that give market players 
long-term plan- ning stability and investment security. As a first step on a national level, 
powerfuels auctions can be an effective in- strument that can create competition between powerfuels 
producers while bringing a set amount of powerfuels into the market;
■  set fuels blending quotas for powerfuels on a national, but especially international level 
coordinated by suprana- tional institutions (e.g. ICAO, IMO). This would leverage the demand for 
powerfuels, create long-term investment per- spectives and pave the way for real GHG reductions;
■  ensure a consistent framework for pricing fossil fuels, with final consumer prices determined by 
energy content and GHG emissions. This means successively phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and 
implementing carbon pricing regimes to create an increasingly level playing field between renewable 
and non-renewable fuels. Additional revenue can be used to facilitate the market development of 
powerfuels.

2 Introduction



By 2050 – the time horizon of the Paris climate goals – the world population is set to increase to 
9.8 billion1 with continu- ing unprecedented economic growth. Climate targets must
be achieved while potentially facing an even higher energy demand than today. This situation 
highlights the importance
of developing and supporting technologies that will guarantee such an energy supply and that will 
help to get on track with the 2-Degree Celsius Scenario (2DS) contained in the Paris Agree- ment. 
To reach its targets, a profound transformation of the global energy system is essential.

Energy efficiency plays an important role. According to IRENA’s “Global Energy Transformation” 
study, global final energy con- sumption can be reduced from 395 EJ in 2016 to 351 EJ in 20503 
(IRENA, 2019). At the same time, the share of renewable energy needs to increase substantially from 
17 to 66 per cent across all sectors by 2050. In this scenario, renewable electricity is used 
directly wherever possible. It is complemented by sustainable biofuels, up to the available 
quantities. The missing link for reaching climate targets is renewable fuels and feedstocks of 
non-biological origin – powerfuels.
Powerfuels are gaseous or liquid fuels and feedstocks, pro- duced using renewable electricity. This 
includes, but is not limited to, hydrogen, synthetic gas and synthetic liquid fuels. According to 
the World Energy Council4, the global demand for powerfuels may reach 10.000 to 41.000 TWh by 2050, 
the equiv- alent of 16 to 66 per cent of today’s global demand of crude oil5. Creating and running 
the associated production facilities means new global energy supply chains – and new opportuni- 
ties for value creation.

Introduction  5

3 Challenges and opportunities

Fossil fuels as we use them today have many advantages: they have a high energy density, are 
storable over a long period of time, flexible in their use, easily transported and production costs 
are low. The basis of these advantages comes from sedi- mentary processes and natural storage 
mechanisms occurring over previous millions of years. The amount of fossil fuels used within one 
year took a million years to be produced6. According to the understanding of the modern economy, 
such production time would be associated with very high costs. Therefore, when discussing the costs 
of renewable fuels, people have to be aware that these costs are not part of today’s fossil fuels 
costs, but are very much part of the costs of renewable resources.
Compared to fossil fuels, renewable fuels depend on the avail- ability of renewable energy sources 
such as solar radiation, wind speed, water, or biomass feedstock. To increase flexibility in the 
use of renewable fuels and to be able to store and trans- port them, energy and cost-intensive 
conversion and refining processes are required.


Therefore, all renewable fuels (e.g. electricity, biofuels, power- fuels) are facing production 
constraints or competitive disad- vantages compared to fossil fuels. Nevertheless, these renew- 
able fuels are key for the future global energy supply and nec- essary to reduce GHG emissions. 
Consistent support for the development of renewable fuels today will be the driving force for 
learning and scale effects, that will guarantee affordable and socially balanced energy costs in 
the future. Facilitating powerfuels markets through the development of entry and growth mechanisms 
is an important prerequisite to increase the use of renewable energies in all sectors.


3.1  The specific role of powerfuels and its opportunities

Gaseous and liquid fuels and feedstocks will still play an impor- tant role in an optimized future 
energy system. From today’s perspective, energy carriers with high energy density as well




Complement to direct electrification in all sectors
Use of existing infrastructure
Energy security and diversification



Powerfuels provide an opportunity to use renewable fuels in all sectors and in nearly all available 
applica- tions. They complement the direct use of renewable energies and will have an important 
role where for ex- ample direct electrification is not possible or economical.
Powerfuels can be integrated com- pletely or partly into the existing gaseous and liquid fuel 
infrastruc- ture, as well as in applications with very long investment cycles.
Since powerfuels offer high flexibility, they contribute to energy security and energy stability, 
e.g. as a flexibility op- tion for electricity grids. As renewable power resources are widely 
distribu- ted around the world, they offer a way to diversify the supply.


Sustainability and costs
Global commodity and new markets
Technologial progress and local benefits



Powerfuels can be more efficient and less resource-intensive than biomass products, but are 
currently more ex- pensive. In the future, costs will con- verge due to technological progress and 
a wider variety of available sus- tainable resources.
Powerfuels could become a tradeable global commodity. Countries with low natural resources but good 
solar and wind conditions will get the chance to improve their own energy supply and become a new 
player in the global energy market.
The development of powerfuels offers benefits such as technological inno- vation and new employment 
in indus- try and in research and development for advanced and emerging market economies.

6  Challenges and opportunities

as specific raw materials have great difficulties being replaced. This can be seen especially in 
both the chemical and transport sectors. Powerfuels are the most sustainable solution to meet the 
energy demand of a growing global economy, even in the future. Technological progress and cost 
reductions in wind and solar power, as well as electrolysers, have been significant in recent 
years. Therefore, even from a cost perspective, there has been an increasing amount of interest in 
creating a market for powerfuels. Combining these factors will mean that powerfuels can offer new 
opportunities.


3.2  Challenges of powerfuels

Worldwide, private and industrial consumers are accustomed to energy prices that exclude external 
costs and often include subsidies7. Under such conditions, renewable fuels – especially powerfuels 
– are unable to reach competitiveness with their non-climate-friendly competitors.
Currently, one of the main challenges are relatively high production costs for powerfuels due to 
the lack of industrial scaling of technology, which means high investment costs (CAPEX). In 
addition, state-induced price elements can sub- stantially increase operational costs (OPEX).

To make powerfuels more cost-competitive, political support is needed to guarantee an increasing 
and continuous global pow- erfuels demand that enables an expansion of renewable ener-
gy production. Evolved regulatory frameworks can positively affect the market-value of powerfuels, 
for example by recog- nizing powerfuels in allowances and quotas. This would create long-term 
planning stability for producers and thus enables investments in production capacities.

Especially in the early market phase, political decision-makers should be aware of the following 
challenges:




High investments (CAPEX), but lower running costs (OPEX)
Trade-off: avoided infrastructure investments vs. additional costs



Powerfuels are currently a relatively new product with high investment costs (CAPEX) that offer 
great potential to reduce the cost of the final product. If renewable power generation is 
considered part of the plant, operational costs (OPEX) are comparably low.
Powerfuels are currently more expensive than other renew- able options. However, they can reduce 
the need for infra- structure investments in the overall system. This trade-off is difficult to 
quantify and communicate in the energy pol- icy debate.


Reduction of production costs
New global renewable energy perspective
Investments risks



Powerfuels are at a very early market stage. They have a very high cost reduction potential, which 
can only be achieved through economies of scale and scope in combination with applied research.
Some of the best powerfuels produc- tion spots are in markets that are not relevant fuel demand 
markets today and can still be considered develop- ing markets in terms of renewable investments.
Some of the best potential power- fuels production sites are located in countries with relatively 
unstable in- vestment conditions. It is important to initiate dialogue with decision makers in such 
countries to identify the potential for local benefit and to reduce investment risks.

Figure 4: Challenges for powerfuels





7  Phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies is the target of the most important economies, 
like the G20 members, the EU28 or the Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). There is a wide 
range of fossil fuel subsidies. The International Energy Agency (IEA) focuses on the price-gap 
approach, which compares average end-user prices with reference prices of full costs for fuel 
supply (Source: IEA, Fossil-fuel subsidies, 2019). The OECD’s Inventory of Support measures for 
fossil fuels uses a wider approach (Source: OECD, Retrieved from Companion to the Inventory of 
Support Measures for Fossil Fuels, 2018). The EU follows a “bottom-up” approach (Source: European 
Commision, Energy prices and costs in Europe, 2019) whose methodology and results are described by 
(Rademaekers, et al., Study on Energy Prices, Costs and Subsidies and their Impact on Industry and 
Households, 2018)

4 Principles for political action
Powerfuels are a missing link for a future low emission energy system. But although being necessary 
for achieving climate mitiga- tion goals, powerfuels are facing competitive disadvantages at 
present. Therefore, political support is necessary for their entry into the global market. The 
following principles for political action are important pillars for a successful market 
development.



Cost efficiency

Political support should help to compensate for the higher costs of new technologies and enable 
competitiveness in the early market phase. To avoid long-term subsidies, an adequate regulative and 
market frame-work must be established and needs to be streamlined with the global GHG emission 
goals. Instruments should be market-based to promote innovation and competition with the aim of 
avoiding overspending and overcompensation. This will enable cost competition in the market.

It is recommended that the regulatory framework primarily supports the development of a stable 
demand for powerfuels as renewable energy carriers and feedstocks to encourage competition and 
avoid stranded investments. To keep the bur- den on public budgets as low as possible, focus should 
be on sectors, where near-term market-driven demand is possible, for example due to sector-specific 
CO₂ abatement costs that allow to more easily close the cost gap between powerfuels and their 
fossil-based counterparts.



Investment and planning security

Long-term security for investment and business decisions are key for scaling the powerfuels market. 
Alternating political decision making decreases trust and prevents investments. Investment 
decisions for capital-intensive assets are made with long-term planning, which require a credible 
commitment to powerfuels support. The market success of powerfuels will not be traced back to one 
single instrument. The package of instruments should be consistent and not contradictory. Polit- 
ical instruments should therefore be a long-term enabler for powerfuels.

Focus on GHG emission reduction and sustainability

GHG emissions are the key global challenge. Political actions should focus on supporting solutions 
which contribute to a sustainable and longer-term emission reduction. Therefore, political 
instruments promoting powerfuels such that their sustainability benefits are fully recognized and 
lead to a high- er market value, should be part of each country’s holistic and comprehensive 
strategy for reducing GHG-emissions.



Emphasis on polluter-pays principle

Considering the urgent need for a rapid reduction of GHG emis- sions, it will not be sufficient to 
only privilege consumers of low emission fuels. In addition, regulation should increasingly 
strengthen the polluter-pays principle in every sector. How- ever, to gain social acceptance, this 
should happen gradually and take sector specific characteristics into consideration. Not all 
sectors can and will proceed at the same pace to implement these principles on a global 
perspective. Hence the most ad- vanced countries will need to lead these developments, and sectors 
with less international competition or tight global regulative frameworks, will have to start 
first.



Overall strategy and sector-specific approach

In a perfect market, the optimal political instruments should incentivise competition between all 
sectors and applications to reduce GHG emissions. This would probably be the most cost- efficient 
path to reducing GHG emissions. In the real world, dif- ferent applications and sectors have very 
different conditions and a very different level of regulation and market framework. Thus, political 
actions to support powerfuels have to be aligned considering the specific characteristics and 
requirements of each key sector.






8  Principles for political actions

5 Sectoral frameworks



Discussions regarding powerfuels often focus on the question of in which sectors and for which 
applications powerfuels are most appropriate. In the long run, a holistic and integrated policy 
framework across all sectors is desirable. However, from today’s perspective and with respect to 
global markets, it seems much more important to create an environment for early investment in 
powerfuels within existing sectoral frame- works. In many ways, sectors currently differ from each 
other in various aspects:

■  Energy consumption for different applications in different sectors is subject to different 
national or international regulation processes.
■ Energy taxes and duties in each sector vary greatly from country to country. Thus, the window of 
opportunity to foster powerfuels will vary by country and sector.
■  The level of international competition in sectors and appli- cations differs greatly. 
Cross-sectoral national mandates towards the use of powerfuels in one region may thus af- fect 
market players’ competitiveness in some sectors much more than in others (e.g. industry vs. heating 
market)
■  Different applications in the sectors have different GHG abatement costs, which is affecting the 
attractiveness to invest in powerfuels under the current political and market framework for 
different industries and sectors (e.g. private transport vs. producing industry).
■  Private and commercial consumers are used to different prices for energy consumption depending 
on applications and sectors, and the acceptance for price increases varies. Moreover, price 
elasticity differs between applications and use cases (e.g. private transport vs. heating market).

Referring to the early phase of powerfuels market development, the previously mentioned examples 
show that it is not sufficient for political decision-makers to only focus on technological 
questions, such as whether there are technological alternatives to powerfuels. More important is 
the question, which political instruments can trigger the market development of powerfuels today 
and how that would affect consumers.

Sectoral framework  9

In this context, it seems relevant to identify the sectors in which consumers have good 
opportunities or alternatives to compensate for increasing fuel costs (e.g. by switching to
more efficient applications), the extent to which basic needs are affected, and which windows of 
opportunities exist in each sector to start powerfuels market development.

The following figures represent a rough overview of the extent to which consumers may be affected 
by political actions to in- tegrate powerfuels in the different sectors, the extent to which
political actions would affect the competitiveness of busi- nesses in the market and also to which 
degree the sectors are influenced by international regulation. The figures have to be understood as 
a schematic description from a global perspec- tive. The importance of certain applications and 
sectors will always depend on certain consumer and region-specific nat- ural, market and policy 
conditions.

8  The figures have to be understood as a schematic description from a global perspective. One has 
to be aware that the importan.ce of certain applications and sectors will always depend on the 
certain consumer and regional-specific geographic, market and policy conditions.

10  Sectoral framework






Effect on basic consumer needs
This category estimates the extent to which an increased fuel price through the use of renewable 
fuels could affect essential consumer needs. It therefore relates to both the extent of the price 
increase as well as the relevance of the affected service or good for average consumption. The 
lighter green part of the scale represents a lesser impact, implying that the gen- eral consumer 
needs are not largely affected. The darker blue areas affect average basic consumer needs even 
more. These assessments refer to the average consumer on a global scale. Therefore, people’s 
reality can diverge from the figures given, depending on individual circumstances.

Opportunities to compensate higher fuel costs
This category estimates how many technical or other possible opportunities are available to 
consumers in order to avoid neg- ative effects of increased fuel prices. The more opportunities 
exist, the better and lighter-coloured the position in the figure. The figure partly shows a wide 
range of opportunities, because these vary greatly depending on the individual conditions and 
preferences. On average, there are many options to reduce heating costs by, for example, changing 
one’s behaviour and through the use of new technologies. But in reality, not every consumer has the 
option to rapidly become a “high efficiency household”. A similar situation can be observed for 
transport. It is not always necessary to travel by car as people’s commutes often entail short 
distances. Public transport can often be
also an alternative for necessary longer distances. Further- more, highly efficient vehicles can 
compensate for the costs of
today’s fuels price increases, even today. In contrast, the op- portunities for aviation are 
limited when it comes to long dis- tances or if there is also a lack of other transport 
infrastructure.

Importance of international competition
International competition between industries determines to this extent the political decision to 
support the use of power- fuels, as political measures should not lead to disadvantages for 
competing local industries that wish to use sustainable, clean fuels. The figure shows that there 
are huge differences between sectors in terms of international competition. For ex- ample, 
international competition for the maritime industry has a much greater importance than it does for 
private transport, where consumers do not compete with other markets. Further- more, neither do 
other markets provide the same service in this case.

Importance of international regulation
In principle, a high degree of international regulation could be advantageous in terms of fostering 
market development in the sectors without though leading to competitive disadvantages for single 
markets. Unfortunately, in the past, international reg- ulated markets have tended to be very 
conservative and slow in terms of progress relating to environmental standards or climate friendly 
technologies. From a current perspective, it seems easier to guarantee rapid success (quick wins) 
in sectors which can be influenced by national politics, whilst addressing international markets at 
the same time in order to foster pow- erfuels market deployment.




The darker blue areas in the figure represent a strong influence or impact for the sector. The 
lighter green areas represent less significance of these challenges in terms of the effect on basic 
needs, the cost increase for consumers, the international com- petitiveness for companies or in the 
sense of finding national or bilateral solutions to integrate powerfuels (which are cost- lier than 
fossil fuels) in the markets. The schematic illustration
shows that powerfuels costs would probably have less of an im- pact in the transport market than in 
the heating market (espe- cially in regions with colder winter periods) or in the production 
industry because there are more alternatives to compensate for the costs and basic consumer needs 
will be affected less. At the same time, maritime, aviation and industry are facing strong 
international competition in contrast to the heating market, private transport or most national 
power markets. The respon- sibility to regulate the market framework predominantly lies with 
national institutions in most sectors, except maritime and aviation. Thus, the potential for rapid 
success (quick wins) in promoting powerfuels is predominantly higher in national or regional 
markets than it is in international regulated markets.

From the current perspective, it can be concluded that

■  Although there are existing universal principles for regu- lation, and powerfuels find 
applications in all (above) sectors, there are different policies and instruments to stimulate 
market development for each sector, which are dependent on the above factors. The choice of 
political instruments can also vary based on the regional market conditions and policy framework 
that already exist.
■  Some sectors may be more suitable for early market-devel- opment of powerfuels, even if other 
GHG abatement tech- nological options are available (e.g. road transport). This mainly results from 
the available opportunities to reduce energy consumption without (greatly) affecting basic con- 
sumer needs.
■  To promote the use of powerfuels in sectors with intense international competition and in 
sectors bound by interna- tional regulations, a much higher level of global awareness is necessary 
in terms of how important powerfuels are. Con- certed action is also essential in order to increase 
aware- ness in many of the developing countries, and to create a new market framework there. 
Furthermore, this also means much more pressure on international organisations to foster the use of 
powerfuels in internationally regulated markets.

6 Policy levers along the value chain

There is a wide range of measures in place to support the mar- ket entry of powerfuels. Many of 
these measures have been im- plemented successfully to establish alternative fuels (biofuels, 
etc.), renewable energy (power) or energy efficiency. Neverthe- less, they do not currently 
consider powerfuels as an option.
The table below lists generic political instruments that can support the use of powerfuels; it also 
specifies effects and examples of their application. In some cases, these instruments can also be 
combined, e.g. carbon pricing with subsidy pro- grammes. Many instruments have already been put 
into practice and just need to be adapted to foster the use of powerfuels. In other cases, there is 
extensive policy experience (e.g. feed-in tariffs, auctions and so forth). With the aim of having a 
holistic approach, it is possible to cluster these instruments as follows9.

Carbon Pricing








Adaptation of fuel prices

Cap-and-trade: setting a cap on GHG emis- sions and allowing trade with allocated cer- tificates, 
creating a market for avoided GHG emissions within all covered sectors.
Carbon tax: puts a flat tax on each
unit of GHG emitted, thereby creating a clear and predictable price for
avoided emissions.


Adapting fuel prices with a focus on ener- gy content and emissions reduces the dif- ference 
between alternative fuels for elec- tricity and fossil fuels. A first step could be to phase out 
subsidies for the exploration, processing and use of fossil fuels.

■ The EU’s and China’s Emissions Trading Scheme (energy and industry).



■ National carbon price floor (UK, California and others).
■ Carbon taxes (Norway, Denmark, Chile, Sweden, Mexico, Ireland and other coun- tries).
■ G20 called to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies (for producer and consu- mer).
■ APEC committed to phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.

Integrating policies: integrate the use of renewable energy in key sectors, such as transport
(i.e. road, maritime and air), heating/cooling and power, into the end-users’ daily life and energy 
system.





Instruments for development of infrastructure for alternative fuels
Subsidising the expansion of the necessa- ry infrastructure for refuelling alternative fuels. 
Especially relevant for hydrogen and CNG/LNG in the transport sector. As alterna- tive fuels 
infrastructure comes with higher cost and initially lower usage, it allows for infrastructure to be 
built and consumers to use corresponding applications.
■ EU funding for alternative fuel deploy- ment (under Clean Mobility
package).
■ Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) programmes (Germany)
■ Renewable Energy Standard in Germany that gives funding for district heating/cool- ing networks 
supplied with energy from renewable resources.

7 Political recommendations



The development of markets for powerfuels depends on varying regional and national as well as 
sector-specific preconditions. This means that not all instruments can be implemented suc- 
cessfully in all countries at the same time, and that the develop- ment of a powerfuels market 
needs a regional approach, too.

However, from the perspective of the Global Alliance Powerfuels, the following political actions 
are recommended with respect to all global markets to foster the market development of power- fuels 
over the next few years.

1. Stakeholders should be made aware of the potential and advantages of powerfuels in politics and 
economies. The international discussion has to be accelerated using reli- able information to 
expose the potential global market de- mand of powerfuels and enable global investment in inno- 
vative powerfuels technologies, particularly in countries with outstanding production conditions.
2. Auctions on national level can be an effective instrument that allows for competition between 
powerfuels producers to bring a guaranteed amount of powerfuels into the mar- ket. Auctions will 
give the market players the highest level of investment security, especially in markets with fast 
learn- ing effects and economies of scale.
3. As a first step in creating powerfuels markets, the reduction potential of GHG emissions from 
powerfuels can be ack- nowledged within the existing energy policy frameworks and regulations in 
all sectors. In some instances, this can provide sufficiently large incentives for the development 
of the powerfuels market and contribute to sector integration.
4. Fuel blending quotas for powerfuels can – on a national level, but especially on an 
international level and within supranational regulated sectors (e.g. aviation/ICAO, mar- itime/IMO) 
– be an important instrument to kick-start glo- bal demand for powerfuels. It would create 
long-term in- vestment perspectives and pave the way for real GHG re- ductions in sectors with 
limited technological alternatives.
5.  A consistent framework for pricing fossil fuels is neces- sary, with final consumer prices 
determined by energy content and GHG emissions. This means successively phas- ing out fossil fuel 
subsidies and implementing carbon pric- ing regimes to create an increasingly level playing field 
between renewable and non-renewable fuels. Additional revenues can be used to facilitate the 
development of the powerfuels market.
6. Further support of Research and Development (R&D) is important to enhance process efficiency, 
improve tech- nology readiness and understand the interplay between
the technologies involved on a large scale. Beside techno- logical questions, R&D support can help 
to evaluate the regional potential of powerfuels, costs and define sustain- able criteria.
7. Global tradability of guarantees of origin (GOOs) for renew- able electricity and used carbon 
for powerfuels require standards and the monitoring of these commodities to be standardised 
globally. An international energy and carbon emission monitoring system should therefore be 
developed.
