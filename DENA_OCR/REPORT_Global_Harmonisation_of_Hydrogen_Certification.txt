„Harmonisation of Hydrogen Certification“  5

Executive Summary

This report analyses whether a uniform global certification system for renewable hydrogen is 
feasible. For this purpose, eleven hydrogen regulations/standards are assessed with regard to their 
commonalities, dif- ferences, and potential for harmonisation (ISCC PLUS, CertifHy, dena 
Biogasregister, TÜV Süd CMS 70, China Hydrogen Alliance’s Standard, the Certification Scheme of the 
Japanese Prefecture Aichi, the Australian Zero Carbon Certification Scheme, the funding programme 
H2Global, the Californian Low Carbon Fuel Standard, the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) II and 
the UK Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation) (Table 1).
Certification of renewable hydrogen and its derivatives serves several purposes. It is an essential 
tool to demonstrate compliance with criteria set in the respective regulatory framework. Once this 
step is taken, con- sumers and companies can credit renewable hydrogen towards private-sector 
obligations – such as in the fuels sector – or even benefit from voluntary commitments. In 
addition, the willingness to pay higher prices for re- newable hydrogen depends on the regulatory 
framework for which certification is a requirement.
The most harmonised sustainability requirements of all eleven hydrogen standards/regulations 
evaluated are the use of renewable electricity inputs, mass balancing as the tracking model, as 
well as the eligibility of all carbon sources, provided that they are not deliberately produced for 
the production of hydrogen and its derivatives.
The assessment concludes that a global certification system will be challenging, as it is unlikely 
that certain markets, e.g. the European Union (EU), would give up their ambitious criteria (e.g. 
the renewable electricity criteria according to Art. 27 RED II in the EU) for the sake of a 
globally harmonised system.
Therefore, the report offers a thought experiment, which proposes a plant concept that is 
recognised by all eleven hydrogen regulations/standards assessed:
•  Direct connection between the renewable power source and the electrolyser
•  GHG reduction of 70% compared to a fossil baseline
•  Carbon source: Atmospheric (DAC)
Furthermore, the chain of custody must be traced by mass balancing, a tracking model where the 
physical delivery of an energy carrier goes hand in hand with the certificate.
However, since this plant concept is linked to relatively high production costs, the study also 
presents further plant concepts which are suitable for different hydrogen standards and regulations 
(Table 11).
The EU is primarily perceived as a potentially large consumer of renewable hydrogen. This can 
already be seen from the requirements of the Fit-for-55 package, which sets significant incentives 
for the use of Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs) in the transport sector and the 
industry. With its regulatory conditions and the associated support instruments for market take-up, 
the EU has created an incentive for producers of renewable hydrogen around the world. For this 
reason, clear documentation and certification requirements regarding RFNBOs are needed to 
demonstrate compliance with sustainability requirements. At the same time, requirements must not be 
too complex or strict, risking the market ramp-up of RFNBOs. If the regulatory con- ditions prove 
to be too strict, there is a risk that large producers of hydrogen and RFNBOs will opt for other 
certification or sales markets altogether and the EU market becomes less attractive in the 
long-term. This de- velopment would be contrary to the EU's ambition to strengthen leadership for 
technical standards, regula- tions and definitions on hydrogen, as defined in the EU’s hydrogen 
strategy.

1 Why harmonise standards for Renewable Hydrogen?

Hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier is increasingly gaining momentum. With more diverse areas 
of ap- plication and reducing costs, the demand for hydrogen is growing worldwide. The European 
Union (EU) in par- ticular, but also countries such as Japan or South Korea, will probably not be 
able to meet their future demand through domestic production and will therefore have to rely on 
imports. In order to complete the transition towards a climate-neutral energy system, proof of the 
sustainable production of hydrogen is just as important as its eligibility for national targets in 
the area of renewable energies and emission reduction for many coun- tries. Establishing proof that 
the hydrogen was produced sustainably is key in this context. Certification can serve this purpose.
Certification mirrors the existing legislative framework, which, in the EU, only foresees state aid 
for renewable hydrogen. Therefore, the focus of this paper is the certification renewable – or 
green – hydrogen, which is de- fined as hydrogen produced from renewable electricity sources such 
as wind, solar, hydro, geothermal and ocean energy. The analysis does not include other productions 
methods – or colours – of hydrogen, like so- called grey, blue or turquoise hydrogen.10 Biobased 
hydrogen was also not considered, since current hydrogen standards/regulations do not cover it.
This paper provides an overview of the certification of hydrogen and its derivatives for the 
transport sector and the industry as the two main target sectors for hydrogen identified by the 
EU’s hydrogen strategy in 2020. The focus lies on renewable hydrogen produced from electrolysis as 
well as hydrocarbons, which are synthesised from hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Examples for 
hydrocarbons include synthetic methane, methanol, ethanol, di-methyl ether, petrol, kerosene and 
diesel. Green ammonia and green metals play a major role for the indus- try sector.
Despite the novelty of the topic, several hydrogen standards already exist. In Germany, TÜV Süd already has a voluntary 
hydrogen standard in place for the transport sector and the industry (CMS 70). ISCC is an established global Voluntary 
Scheme (🡪 Glossary) recognised by the European Commission (EC) and has already voiced its aim to expand its 
portfolio towards hydrogen. It also seeks to be recognised by the EC, once the Delegated Act based on Art. 27 
(3) RED II provides more clarity on the renewable electricity criteria for the production of Renewable Fuels of 
Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs) for the transport sector. However, under ISCC PLUS renew- able hydrogen can 
already get certified. ISCC PLUS is a voluntary market-based scheme for bio-based and re- cycled raw materials 
for all markets and sectors not regulated as transportation fuels under the European Re- newable Energy 
Directive (EU RED) or Fuel Quality Directive (FQD). The CMS 70 has been developed by TÜV Süd itself, whereas 
certification schemes like The Roundtable of Biomaterials (RSB) or ISCC are multi-stakeholder initiatives 
linking different stakeholder groups. The Voluntary Schemes are not separately listed in this report but 
represented by the Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II), unless RED II does not cover the respective as- 
pect, yet (see social impact chapter 4.7). CertifHy started as an EU project with the aim of setting up a 
Guaran- tees of Origin (GO) (🡪 Glossary) scheme for hydrogen. However, CertifHy is now aiming to be 
recognised as a



10 The production pathways of hydrogen are often categorised according to colours. Although there 
is no universally accepted colour coding, grey hydrogen usually refers to hydrogen which was 
produced based on fossil fuels, like natural gas or coal. Blue hydrogen refers to hydrogen from 
fossil fuels where the CO2 is captured and stored. Turquoise hydrogen is hydrogen that has been 
produced via methane pyrolysis. Instead of CO2, solid carbon is produced in the process.

Voluntary Scheme under the EC as well. In Australia, the Smart Energy Council (SME) – a non-profit 
organisa- tion for the solar, storage and smart energy industries – launched the Zero Carbon 
Certification Scheme for hydrogen and its derivatives for the domestic as well as international 
market in December 2020 (KAS, 2022).

This report presents an overview of regulations and associated standards concerning hydrogen 
production for the transport sector and the industry, as shown in Table 2.

according to several standards or a producer would have to decide on one customer region. This 
restriction means that producers need to decide at an early stage with what country they aim to 
trade the energy carrier volumes with, in order to demonstrate compliance with the respective 
renewable criteria. This entails limited flexibility as well as increased efforts and thus higher 
prices for the products and might create dependencies by limiting a few producers to certain 
regions. Therefore, it is necessary to open the discussion about harmo- nising the different 
systems. This paper enables market players to see where sustainability criteria of the dif- ferent 
schemes share commonalities, and which criteria divert from one another and could be certified at a 
later stage as an “add-on”.
When the paper refers to sustainability criteria, it is referring to the totality of all criteria 
related to renewable hydrogen, such as renewable electricity consumption, tracking models, GHG 
emissions, eligible carbon sources, land use change, water consumption, and social impacts.
Further publications that compare hydrogen standards were published by BEIS, Velazquez, Abad and 
Dodd (2020), Azni and Md Khalid (2021) as well as Adelphi (2019).
In the last chapter of the paper a plant concept is presented, that complies with all eleven 
standards/regulatory frameworks (Table 1) for renewable hydrogen, which have been assessed.

2 Requirements for Green Hydrogen

Requirements for green hydrogen and its derivatives are dependent on the regulatory framework. 
However, the definitions elaborated in these regulatory frameworks may differ not only between 
countries but also be- tween application sectors. The hydrogen strategy and roadmaps often give a 
first impression of how govern- ments set the terms and requirements in the field of renewable 
hydrogen.
Australia
The Australian government adopted a national hydrogen strategy in November 2019. This provides for 
various parameters to ensure the success of the strategy. The strategy aims to establish a 
certification system that is internationally recognised and ensures that the carbon intensity of 
Australian hydrogen production decreases over time. Furthermore, the strategy will only be 
considered a success if water use in hydrogen production has improved and the safety track record 
is excellent (Australian Government, 2019). The Australian government focuses more on coal and gas 
based production pathways than renewable ones (KAS, 2022). The government does not yet have any 
regulation for the certification and recognition of renewable hydrogen in place. The De- partment 
of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources has developed a proposal in cooperation with the Inter- 
national Partnership for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells in the Economy (IPHE). The consultation phase on 
this pro- posal ended in August 2021 (Australian government, 2021). For the time being, the 
proposal provides for a well- to-gate approach to calculate emissions and discusses the question of 
accounting for captured emissions. The trial phase of such a scheme has already started (Minister 
for industry, 2021). To implement a GO scheme with a central registry on the federal level, either 
new legislation could be passed or integration into the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting 
(NGER) Act could be sought. The Clean Energy Regulator would be in charge of collecting, analysing 
and using the information about producer and consumer. The Department of Industry, Science, Energy 
and Resources proposes that Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGC) could be used to track and 
verify renewable electricity claims of hydrogen producers.
The industry-led initiative Smart Energy Council launched its Zero Carbon Certification Scheme in 
December 2020 (KAS, 2022). Among the founding partners are four regional governments. The focus is 
on renewable hy- drogen, renewable ammonia, and on renewable metals produced in Australia, where 
renewable hydrogen is used in production (Smart Energy Council, 2020). The first pilot 
certification was conducted on a hydrogen refuelling station in March 2021 (KAS, 2022).
Canada
In 2020, Canada released its National Hydrogen Strategy, and is currently developing a Clean Fuel 
Standard. The standard covers biofuels and hydrogen. It sets a net-zero emission target by 2050 and 
aims to develop a lifecycle approach regarding its GHG methodology. Furthermore, it points to 
establish a credit market for fuels with low carbon intensity. The CertifHy Canada Scheme is 
currently under development and aims to mirror the requirements of the Clean Fuel Standard 
(Government of Canada, 2021). The Bureau de normalisation du Qué- bec (BNQ) is also currently 
working on a national standard on the traceability of renewable hydrogen. This project will measure 
the environmental impact of the energy source and the hydrogen production process overall.










12

China
In 2016, China released its first Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicle (FCV) Technology Roadmap with the aim 
to have 5,000 FCVs and 100 hydrogen refuelling stations by 2020 (ISPI, 2021). In 2021, China has 
released a China Hy- drogen Alliance’s Standard, which distinguishes between low-carbon (14.51 
kgCO2e/kgH2), clean and renewa- ble hydrogen (4.9 kgCO2e/kgH2) (China Electricity Council, 2021).
European Union
The European Union released its “Hydrogen strategy for a climate-neutral Europe” on June 2020. The 
Euro- pean Hydrogen Strategy aims to decarbonise hydrogen production and widen its application onto 
sectors in which it substitutes fossil fuels. It focuses on renewable hydrogen and is the first 
step towards a regulatory framework for the respective energy carrier in the EU. It voices that 
life cycle GHG emissions should be close to zero. Hydrogen is regarded as renewable, when it 
results from electrolysis, renewable sources and reforming of biogas or biochemical conversion of 
biomass, as long as it complies with sustainability requirements. The EU Taxonomy regulation for 
assessing whether an economic activity contributes to the climate goals mentions explicit emission 
reduction targets for hydrogen production.
In the EU, the Renewable Energy Directive II (RED II) 19 is the only regulation so far, which sets 
criteria for the production and use of renewable hydrogen20. RED II promotes the use of renewable 
energy sources in the transport sector. No regulations are currently available on sustainability 
requirements for hydrogen applica- tions in the industry sector, which will change with the 
undergoing revision of the RED II.
Sustainability requirements were already made mandatory for biofuels under RED I and have been 
continu- ously developed to ensure the protection of land and biodiversity and to document target 
compliance for re- newable biofuels in the transport sector. RED II also includes RFNBOs as an 
option for meeting the renewable energy targets in the transport sector.

RED II Art. 27 defines rules for renewable electricity production for the transport sector. It 
covers “Rules for counting electricity sourced from directly connected installations as fully 
renewable” as well as “Rules for counting electricity taken from the grid as fully renewable”. The 
Commission in its proposal aims to introduce PPAs -as a bilateral contract- for the second option. 
The criteria for renewable electricity consumption of RFNBOs via the grid will be further refined 
by a Delegated Act on Art 27. The publication of this Delegated Act by the European Commission is 
still pending. This paper, however, considers the content of leaked draft docu- ments.

A further Delegated Act on RED II Art. 28 will outline the methodology for assessing GHG emission 
savings from RFNBOs, including sustainability criteria regarding eligible carbon sources for 
hydrocarbon powerfuels. RED II contains the following sustainability requirements for renewable 
hydrogen: renewable electricity crite- ria (Art. 27), mass balancing of the produced volumes along 
the value chain (Art. 30), and information on re- ceived state aid (Art. 30) (for more detail see 
chapter 4). Mass balancing is also an essential requirement in the Implementing Act on rules on 
rules to verify sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria and low indirect 
land-use change-risk criteria.





19 Currently under revision.
20 ‘renewable hydrogen’ is defined in RED II as hydrogen derived only from renewable energy sources 
other than biomass.

EXCURSUS: Germany’s Funding Programme H2Global

H2Global is a funding concept to achieve the goals set out in the German National Hydrogen 
Strategy. The Federal Min- istry of Finance is tasked with its implementation. The funding is 
intended for large-volume projects in third countries that intend to export the renewable hydrogen 
to Germany. Traded volumes should reach a level that makes hydrogen usage attractive. For this 
purpose, purchase contracts are auctioned abroad, which include a fixed quantity at fixed prices 
for 10 years (BMWi, 2021). Hydrogen volumes imported via and compliant with H2Global requirements 
are eli- gible for the EU-ETS. The concept was developed by the German Society for International 
Cooperation (GIZ) and is now being further developed by German Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association 
(DWV). The funding pro- gramme follows a market-based approach through compensation of differential 
costs between purchase and sales price (Contracts for Difference). Maximum amount of funding is €15 
million per applicant and pro- ject. Detailed funding guidelines are yet to be published.
Funding requirements

•  Permanent establishment or branch in Germany at the time of payment of the grant

•  Country of implementation: States outside the EU and EFTA

•  Obligation to operate: Systems must be operated for at least 3 years after commissioning

•  Project implementation not possible without funding

•  Proof of the pre-development status of the project (e.g. preliminary studies, availability of 
land in the country of implementation of the project, permits)
The preliminary sustainability criteria cover the renewable electricity criteria, similar to RED 
II, eligible carbon sources, GHG performance, water consumption, compliance with land use 
requirements, land use change and forestry (LULUFC), and local labour standards based on the ILO 
standards (for more detail see chapter 4) (Altrock, 2021).

Japan aims to be carbon-neutral by 2050 (KAS, 2022). The Japanese government has granted hydrogen 
and fuel cells a central role in its fourth Strategic Energy Plan. In 2018 the fifth Strategic 
Energy Plan was released which focuses on mobility and the power sector (Adelphi, 2019). The 
detailed roadmap of hydrogen expansion is laid out in the Basic Hydrogen Strategy and the Strategic 
Roadmap for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells. In 2019, Japan adopted its third Roadmap for Hydrogen and Fuel 
Cells. The strategy focuses on the reduction of pro- duction costs of fossil-based hydrogen as well 
as carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies. It also mentions the importance of GHG 
reductions along the hydrogen supply chain. Furthermore, the regulation sets a strong emphasis on 
hydrogen imports. For that reason, the roadmap entails the plan to establish a global hydrogen 
supply chain and foster international partnerships (New Zealand Embassy, 2020). So far, there is no 
clear definition of the term “clean hydrogen” which is why it covers hydrogen produced from fossil 
sources and nuclear sources in combination with renewable sources and CCS. A government committee 
discussed the need for standards and a certification scheme, but up to now, there are no further 
developments known on this matter. However, on a regional level the Aichi Prefecture has 
established a certification scheme for CO2-free hydrogen in 2018. The Aichi Prefecture is also 
where the headquarter of Toyota is located. Toyota aims to be carbon neutral by 2050. The scheme 
defines renewable hydrogen as hydrogen from water electrolysis using renewable electricity sources 
or from steam-reforming using biomass (Adelphi, 2019). Five projects have al- ready been certified 
by the Aichi scheme, of which four are projects undertaken by Toyota (KAS, 2022). Japan

has also a carbon credit scheme (J-Credit Scheme) in place in order to certify GHG reductions and 
removals (J- Credit Scheme, 2020).
Switzerland
The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment sets the standards for sustainable fuel production. 
The regula- tions in Switzerland are spread across various legislations, which are currently under 
revision, including a ref- erendum on the reduction of GHG emissions on June 13, 2021.Produced 
hydrogen volumes must comply to the Mineral Oil Tax Act (MinöStG), the Mineral Oil Tax Regulation 
(MinöStV) and the UVEK (Federal Energy De- partment) Regulation concerning evidence of compliance 
with ecological requirements (BTrV) (gaz energie, 2020). Furthermore, gaz energie has also 
developed principles for the production of renewable gases, which are also accepted as voluntary 
standards by market players. One of those principles is to exclusively use re- newable electricity 
and provide proof that the gas was actually fed into the gas grid. The competent authority for the 
sustainability certification of biofuel is the Swiss Federal Department for Environment, 
Transports, En- ergy and Telecommunications. The Swiss regulations require renewable input for 
renewable RFNBO produc- tion (MinöStG, Art. 2(3); MinöStV, Art. 19e). Hydrogen volumes placed on 
the market must be registered with the Clearing Center (MinöStV, Art. 45e).
South Korea
In 2019, South Korea has adopted a Hydrogen Roadmap for the transport and industry sector until 
2030 (Azni & Md Khalid, 2021). The Roadmap proposes the extension of the Renewable Portfolio 
Standards (RPS) and the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) scheme. The RPS requires energy 
producers to provide a certain percent- age of their energy portfolio from renewable energy either 
by own renewable energy installations or the pur- chase of certificates (Velazquez Abad & Dodds, 
2020). In February 2021, the Hydrogen Economy Promotion and Hydrogen Safety Management Act was 
implemented. Compared to the other regulatory frameworks in this paper, South Korea is the only 
studied country with a hydrogen-specific law in place. This act promotes producers through 
subsidies, loans and tax exemptions (Azni & Md Khalid, 2021). However, the law mainly fo- cuses on 
safety and technology standards. It has been criticized that the law neglects the aspect of GHG 
emis- sion reduction (Sun-Jae et al., 2020). Sun-Jae et al. (2020) also calls for a certification 
scheme.
United Kingdom
The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) regulates the market for renewable fuels in the UK. 
It sets sustainability criteria for biofuels, hydrogen and RFNBOs supplied under the RTFO and 
provides guidance how to demonstrate compliance. The RTFO allows also for the case, if the fuel is 
partially produced by RE and par- tially by fossil-based electricity. It is defined part RFNBO and 
part fossil fuel. However, both consignments are assigned to the same GHG intensity. Detailed 
information on the sustainability criteria are laid out in the Car- bon and Sustainability 
requirements (C & S requirements) of the RTFO (RTFO, 2018). Producers register with the UK 
Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) in order to be able to claim both, Renewable Transport 
Fuel Certificates (RTFC) and Greenhouse gas credits. The C & S requirements of the RTFO also 
provide a GHG emission methodology for the production and use of RFNBOs (see chapter 4.3). The UK 
is currently in the pro- cess of designing a low-carbon and renewable hydrogen standard, for which 
a first report with recommenda- tions has recently been published. In the next step the results of 
the report will be discussed with stakeholder (BEIS, 2021).









„Harmonisation of Hydrogen Certification“  15

United States - California
In 2006, California introduced the Senate Bill No. 1505 to promote hydrogen production from 
renewable sources. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) governs the Bill and sets the target 
to produce 33% of total hydrogen volumes from renewable sources. In 2018, California has adopted 
the Renewable Hydrogen Roadmap. California has one of the most advanced legal frameworks for 
hydrogen (Azni & Md Khalid, 2021). Since 2011, the State of California adopted the Low Carbon Fuel 
Standard (LFCS), which aims to reduce GHG emissions. One LCFS credit – released through emission 
reduction, equals one Mt CO2equ. In the LFCS, renewa- ble hydrogen is defined as (Velazquez Abad & 
Dodds, 2020):
1. Hydrogen from electrolysis based on renewable energy
2.  Catalytic cracking or steam methane reforming based on biomethane
3.  Thermochemical conversion of biomass
Guidance for CCS projects is provided by the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Protocol under the 
LCFS, which provides information on the application and certification of the protocol as well as 
its monitoring. Thus, also DAC projects are eligible to receive LCFS credits (CARB, 2018b).
Hydrogen is currently an opt-in fuel in the Low Carbon Fuels Standard (LCFS) program, in which 
entities can volunteer to participate in the program to generate credits. There are currently three 
default categories where hydrogen can generate credits, for fuel reported in light-duty, 
heavy-duty, and forklifts (CARB, 2020).

3 Certification Governance

In order to demonstrate compliance with the sustainability requirements listed in chapter 2, 
certification is required. This chapter describes the certification structure in China, the EU, the 
UK and California regarding the application process, certification bodies and data handling.

3.1 China
For the China Hydrogen Alliance’s Standard, the applicant has to submit a formal verification 
application form to the public service platform recognised by the national energy authority. A 
third party, recognised by the service platform, will conduct the on-site audit to prove the 
submitted documents in accordance to the stand- ard. Certification is conducted annually. The 
producer has to inform the auditor, if the production process changes. It is then up to the auditor 
to decide, if additional audits are required (FuelCellChina, 2020).

3.2 European Union
To show compliance with the obligation regarding the usage of renewable fuels, the producer shall 
report the quantity of RFNBOs placed on the market and their associated greenhouse gas emissions 
towards the respon- sible authority. This can be done by Proofs of Sustainability (PoS), if a 
national registry is in place.
This is preceded by a chain of evidence starting with the purchase of electricity and ending with 
the consump- tion of the fuel. A comprehensive certification process has been established to ensure 
that sustainability is fully documented. An overview of the certification process in the EU is 
illustrated in Figure 1.




















Figure 1: PoS certification process and linked competent bodies (modified from Sailer et al. 
(2021))







„Harmonisation of Hydrogen Certification“  17

Voluntary Schemes
Voluntary Schemes help to ensure that the respective renewable fuel has been sustainably produced 
according to RED II. Currently, the recognized schemes mirror the criteria set in the RED. Some 
schemes also cover addi- tional aspects such as soil, water and air protection as well as social 
criteria (Mai-Moulin et al., 2019). The schemes are either national schemes (e.g. in Italy) or 
privately owned. After the Delegated Acts regarding the renewable electricity criteria and the GHG 
methodology including carbon sources are released, certification schemes can seek recognition by 
the EC in order to certify powerfuels. Recognition for a Voluntary Scheme can last for a period of 
five years. Within the biofuel domain, there are currently 16 Voluntary Schemes recognized by the 
EC. Some of them are expected to widen their portfolio towards hydrogen and seek recognition by the 
EC for it, for instance ISCC. However, there will be also new players entering the field of 
certification (e.g. Cer- tifHy, Zero Carbon Certification Scheme).
Certification Bodies
Certification Bodies are recognized under different Voluntary Schemes according to their portfolio 
and are re- sponsible for conducting the respective audits. They audit the production installations 
and batches in regard to GHG emission reductions or, in the future, validate renewable electricity 
consumption via the public grid in the case of electricity-based gases.
National registries and their issuing bodies
Some countries have national registries, which issue PoS for biofuels. In Germany, the respective 
registry is Nabisy and in Austria it is elNA. In Germany, the responsible authority for PoS is the 
German Federal Agency for Agriculture and Food (BLE). However, not every member state has such a 
centralized registry in place.
Union Database
In order to prevent double/multiple counting (🡪 Glossary) of sustainability certificates, the RED 
II Art. 28 (2; 4) foresees a Union Database (UDB) on EU level. This will centrally store the 
respective certificates and their linked aggregated data for liquid and gaseous fuels that
(1) are eligible for being counted towards the national renewable energy transport targets (RED II, 
Art. 3), and
(2) fulfil the set sustainability and GHG reduction criteria.
The UDB aims to enhance transparency and traceability regarding PoS (Sailer et al., 2021). 
Guidehouse (2020) published a report on the scoping and specific technical requirements of such a 
database. The report diverts from RED II by not only offering the option for certificate storage, 
but also providing user accounts for producers who might not have a national registry in place 
(yet). This means that the UDB will not only be linked to national registries (e.g. Nabisy in 
Germany), but will also enable direct user accounts (see Figure 1).
During an interactive event stakeholder in April 2021 the Directorate-General for Energy (DG ENER) 
of the EC presented that the UDB will entail two different system boundaries depending on the level 
of fraud risk regard- ing the respective value chain:
1)  Low risk value chain: Starting from the collection point/trader
2)  High risk value chain: Starting from point of origin (farms, restaurants, etc.).
Furthermore, with the revision of RED II, the EC envisages to extend the sectoral scope of the UDB 
from transport further to the industry, power production as well as heating & cooling – excluding 
solid biomass fuels. The final implementation of the UDB is envisaged for December 2022 (EC, 2021).





18

3.3 United Kingdom
The UK Department for Transport (DfT) operates the RTFO Operating System (ROS). Fuel producers are 
obliged to report their fuel volumes and their sustainability performance in ROS, if they place at 
least 450,000 litres per year on the British market. Other suppliers can report their volumes in 
ROS on a voluntary basis. Suppliers with an obligation have to register for an account with the 
administrator. Once the data is complete, an independent third party according to the ISAE 3000 
standard must verify it. For this purpose, Voluntary Schemes – recog- nized by the EC – can be 
used, e.g. ISCC and RED Tractor for biodiesel. For hydrogen, there are no Voluntary Schemes 
mentioned in the guidance documents of the RTFO yet. The DfT has requested ISCC to include the 
RFNBO requirements of RTFO within ISCC EU and provide guidance for the verification process. So 
far, it has not been taken up on. Once, the verification is conducted, the producer is responsible 
for submitting the ap- plication in the ROS. RTFCs are issued on a monthly cycle (RTFO, 2018).

3.4 United States – California
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) developed the LCFS Data Management System, which 
comprises of three modules:
•  LCFS Reporting Tool (LRT)
•  Credit Bank and Transfer System (CBTS)
•  Alternative Fuel Portal (AFP).
The three modules have different functionalities and the AFP requires a separate account. If an 
entity seeks to be accepted under zero-CI electricity and hydrogen (section 95488.1(b)(2)(A) 
through (F)), it must register at the AFP. The AFP offers a fuel pathway certification application 
and evaluation process. The Californian Green- house Gas, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in 
Transportation (CA-GREET) model is used to calculate car- bon intensities (CI). The process 
distinguishes between Lookup Table pathway, Tier 1 and Tier 2 pathway. The certification process of 
Tier 1 is designed as follows (CARB, 2021a):
1.  Facility registration in AFP
2.  Application submission to AFP
3. Validation performed by accredited verification bodies (CARB, 2021b)
4.  Final evaluation through CARB staff
5. Certification
6.  Verification through verification body.
The reporting takes place on a quarterly basis. Any pathways with biomethane attributes are 
required to be verified by an approved third-party verifier, while electricity attributes are 
verified by CARB staff.
The LCFS has 30 accredited verification bodies (e.g. Tetra Tech Inc., Trinity Consultants Inc.) in 
place, which conduct the audits (CARB, 2021b).
In principle, all three certification structures (EU, UK and USA/CA) are similar. The producers 
have to register their generated volumes in a registry and a third linked party audits the 
production installations and the pro- duction batches, based on which a competent body issues the 
PoS.

4 Verification process

As shown in the previous chapters, the requirements for the products are different. The following 
chapter elab- orates on the different sustainability aspects of renewable hydrogen/RFNBO production 
covered in the differ- ent regulatory frameworks and standards. When the paper refers to 
sustainability criteria, it is referring to the totality of all criteria related to renewable 
hydrogen, such as renewable electricity consumption, tracking mod- els, GHG emissions, eligible 
carbon sources, land use change, water consumption, and social impacts.
The relevant aspects are arranged along the energy carrier’s value chain. First, the requirements 
for demon- strating use of sustainable electricity and models for tracking the product from 
production to end-use are ex- plained, followed by the existing methodologies for calculating the 
greenhouse gas emissions saved as well as eligible carbon sources. Finally, criteria for water 
consumption, land use and social impacts are presented.

4.1 Renewable electricity consumption
In order to ensure that the electricity used to produce electrolysis-based hydrogen has itself been 
generated sustainably, very different requirements exist in the various laws and standards on 
hydrogen/RFNBOs (see Ta- ble 3). In RED II, for example, the EU places a strong focus on utilising 
additionally produced electricity capac- ities for the RFNBO production. In contrast, other 
regulatory frameworks – outside of the EU – focus more on the exclusive consumption of renewable 
electricity as an input.
Regarding the dena Biogasregister, as soon as the Delegated Acts will officially be published, the 
register will also cover the foreseen national adaption of subsequent ordinances of the Federal 
Immission Control Act (BIm- SCHG), as well as the criteria of the H2Global funding programme for 
international hydrogen projects.
TÜV Süd and CertifHy are awaiting the adoption of the Delegated Act specifying the EU’s 
requirements for elec- tricity sources to extend their sustainability criteria in respect to the 
RED II criteria as well.

4.2 Tracking models
For renewable electricity, many functioning systems worldwide for tracking the origin or 
sustainability of the product already exist. In contrast to electricity, hydrogen and its 
derivatives are molecules, which can have different physical properties depending on the 
manufacturing process or similar. To trace the chain of custody two approaches were identified 
among the assessed hydrogen regulations/standards: mass balancing and Book & Claim.


Book & Claim
In the case of Book & Claim, the physical delivery of the energy carrier and the issuance of the 
respective cer- tificate are not linked to each other (dena, 2021a). Book & Claim is therefore a 
mechanism of pure certificate trading. The certificates represent a precisely determinable quantity 
of sustainable hydrogen that is produced, but not physically traded as certified goods. Similar to 
renewable electricity, a tradable certificate is issued to the producers, which can be auctioned by 
the manufacturers of end-products via a bidding process (FONAP, 2021). GO schemes under RED II Art. 
19 follow the Book & Claim principle.
A Book & Claim principle would allow certificates to be traded separately from the physical 
product, thus pav- ing the way for more flexibility. This aspect is relevant against the background 
that any trading restrictions in form of physical transport obligations between individual 
countries may lead to the creation of separate na- tional and less liquid markets for renewable and 
low-carbon gases, which would then have the potential to further split the market into small 
submarkets for e.g. renewable hydrogen, low-carbon and other kind of re- newable gases.


Mass balancing
The mass balancing approach links the certificate with the respective physical delivery of the 
energy carrier. Sustainability certificates are traded via mass balancing, so that a physical 
delivery of an energy carrier goes hand in hand with the certificate. Within the framework of the 
mass balance, an exchange of qualitative prop- erties is possible via the PoS. In addition, the 
renewable energy carrier can still be traced if it is mixed with fossil

29 KAS (2022)





„Harmonisation of Hydrogen Certification“  23

energy carriers. The mass balance primarily serves the purpose of tracing a renewable energy 
carrier from its use to its production. Thus, a physical link is established throughout the value 
chain. There are, however, dif- ferent views regarding the delivery form in a mass balance system. 
The use of the natural gas grid, into which hydrogen can be fed but not withdrawn in its pure form, 
would only be possible if the definition of renewable hydrogen refers only to the energy content.
In the dena Biogasregister, mass balancing of hydrogen starts at the electrolyser and ends at the 
end consumer. However, the consumed renewable electricity is traced as well, but the electricity 
plant is not registered in the system.
Requirements for mass balancing of hydrogen are the following (Sailer et al., 2021):
-  Supply contract for renewable hydrogen and meter data must be provided along the entire chain of 
custody.
-  The delivery has been documented in a mass balance system (e.g. dena Biogasregister).
-  Gaseous RFNBO: Documentation of interface point (injection and extraction meter points).
-  Liquid RFNBO: Delivery notes from transport companies.
In case of multiple outputs, the produced hydrogen volume is distributed among the outputs by 
percentage basis or attribution. An example for multiple outputs would be to produce multiple 
end-products from the renewable hydrogen e.g. e-methanol for the transport sector and green metal 
for the industry.

4.3 GHG emissions
According to the EU REGATRACE project33, the main drivers of the GHG performance of hydrogen 
generated from electrolysis are the emissions from the electricity production and the emissions 
caused by the electro- lyser itself (Majer et al., 2021). Wulf et al. (2018) conclude that in case 
of distribution by pressure tank on a truck, truck driving has the largest share of emissions, 
while in case of pipeline transport, the electricity used for the electrolysis has the strongest 
influence. In contrast to hydrogen, the production of other RFNBO such as Power- to-Liquid (PtL) 
jet fuel requires additional process steps. Further processing with carbon sources as well as 
conditioning have a significant impact on the GHG emissions results. The same applies to the 
different transport and distribution modes or retail options depending on the end use.
To ensure creditability, renewable hydrogen producers are obliged to provide a GHG calculation of 
their pro- duction volumes in accordance to the respective regulatory requirements (chapter 2). 
During the audit of the production batch, the GHG calculation is checked for accuracy and 
plausibility.
The UK RTFO, CertifHy and TÜV Süd CMS 70 already have a GHG calculation methodology in place. The 
meth- odology must comply with the requirements of ISO 14040, 14044 (Life-cycle assessment) or 
14067 (Product carbon footprint).
It is foreseen that the EC will publish a Delegated Act in 2022, which further specifies the GHG 
methodology for RFNBOs and how to account for different carbon sources. Either the individual 
values of such a methodology are calculated individually or one falls back on default values, which 
mostly amount to an average value for this kind of value chain step. Regarding biofuels, RED II 
offers the possibility for an individual, manual calcula- tion as well as a calculation according 
to default values, which are published by the Joint Research Centre (JRC). It can be assumed, that 
the EC will also provide these two options for RFNBOs.


GHG reduction targets
The different regulations and standards have different GHG reduction targets and reference 
baselines in place as shown in Table. The TÜV Süd standard’s GHG targets distinguish between 
sectors and installations imple- mented before 2016 and after. RTFO does the same for installations 
before and after 2015.

System boundaries
The different regulations listed in chapter 2 as well as the Voluntary Schemes and Certification 
bodies in chap- ter 3 have different carbon accounting boundaries in place. This makes their 
comparability very challenging. The RED II methodology, the Swiss MinöStV, RTFO, California LCFS, 
and TÜV Süd CMS 70 cover the system

boundaries from the electricity input to hydrogen usage (Well-to-Wheel). Dena Biogasregister, 
CertifHy and Zero Carbon Certification Scheme cover GHG system boundaries from Well-to-Gate.
In comparison to Life-Cycle-Assessment approaches, there is no scheme worldwide to date that 
accounts for the embedded emissions in CAPEX (e.g. building material of electrolyser) or the end of 
life phase – although it has been proven that emissions from the actual construction of hydrogen 
infrastructure such as the electro- lyser can be significant (Majer et al., 2021).















Figure 2: Carbon accounting system boundaries

Another similar approach of the existing certification schemes, such as the California LCFS or 
CertifHy is to divide the value chain into different life cycle stages: (1) emissions before the 
point of production, (2) between production and point of use, and (3) the end use and end of life 
phase.


GHG emission calculation methodology

The UK RTFO is the only regulation, which offers a methodology for calculating the GHG performance 
of RFNBOs (see Equation 1). According to the UK RTFO GHG methodology for RFNBOs, the electricity 
gets the GHG value assigned, which is equal to the GHG intensity of the average electricity 
production and distribution of the respective country measured two years prior to the year in 
question. The emissions associated with the fuel in use for renewable liquid and gaseous transport 
fuels of non-biological origin can be assigned to a value of 0 gCO2equ/MJ (RTFO, 2018). The LCFS 
published carbon intensity default values for six different hydrogen path- ways (see Table F.3 
(CARB, 2018a)).

















„Harmonisation of Hydrogen Certification“  27

Equation 1: GHG emission methodology for the production and use of RFNBOs according to the C & S 
requirements of the UK RTFO


𝐸 = 𝑒𝑒𝑐 + 𝑒𝑝 + 𝑒𝑡𝑑 + 𝑒𝑢 − 𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑠 − 𝑒𝑒𝑒


E    =    total emissions from the use of the fuel;
eₑc    =    emissions from the extraction or collection of raw materials; ep    =    emissions from 
processing;
etd    =    emissions from transport and distribution; eu    =    emissions from the fuel in use;
eccs   =   emissions savings from carbon capture and geological storage; eee    =   emissions 
savings from excess electricity from cogeneration.

4.4 Eligible carbon sources
Three different types of carbon sources could be utilised for powerfuels production: fossil-based 
carbon, bi- ogenic carbon, and atmospheric carbon. Fossil-based carbon originates from industrial 
CO2 point sources such as a coal plant. Biogenic carbon is released from biomass through 
fermentation, combustion, decompo- sition or processing. Atmospheric carbon is harnessed via Direct 
Air Capture (DAC) technologies (Global Alli- ance Powerfuels, 2020). In the UK RTFO, instead of 
atmospheric carbon, the term of naturally occurring car- bon was introduced which contains 
atmospheric as well as geothermal carbon.

The main challenge with regard to the certification of RFNBOs is that it is not clear, yet, which 
carbon sources will be eligible for RFNBOs and how the different sources should be accounted for in 
the GHG calculation meth- odology in order to ensure an attractive business case for all actors 
involved in CCU (Sailer et al., 2021). CCS is commonly applied in standards, whereas there are yet 
no harmonised or consistent rules for CCU in place (BEIS, 2021; DG ENER, 2020; Sailer et al., 
2021). TÜV Süd and LCFS do currently not allow for CCU, and RED II and RTFO only allow for biogenic 
CCU. LCFS even accounts for avoided landfilling benefits (BEIS, 2021).

In the EU, a Delegated Act of RED II should provide more clarity on this matter. So far, the EC in 
its proposal for the revision of the EU Emission Trading System has already proposed that the 
emitter should be treated un- changed, while the conversion plant gets the carbon reduction 
credited. The emissions associated with the carbon capture should be assigned to the conversion 
plant, except the carbon would have been captured an- yway to obtain a marketable product (DG ENER, 
2020; Sailer et al., 2021).

The Californian LCFS has a methodology for greenhouse gas emissions reductions calculation in 
place:
𝐺𝐻𝐺𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝐶𝑂2 𝑖𝑛𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 − 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡

4.5 Land use change
Land use change criteria are already implemented in RED II for biofuels, not for powerfuels. Only 
H2Global, ISCC PLUS, and LCFS address land use criteria for powerfuels. However, it can be expected 
that the criteria to mitigate ILUC-risk in the biofuel sector will simply be transferred to 
powerfuels and biogenic carbon sources. BEIS (2021) recommends to include emissions related to ILUC 
into the UK low carbon hydrogen standard.

4.6 Water consumption
Water consumption is only mentioned implicitly in RED II and H2Global funding requirements. Both 
aim to avoid excessive water use. However, ISCC considers it within its GHG methodology, in which 
water from a de- salination plant has 44 times higher GHG emissions than European tab water 
(filtrated, disinfected).41 Consid- ering the total GHG emissions of renewable hydrogen (26 g 
CO2/kWh (Greenpeace Energy, 2020), the emissions associated with water are negligible. Water 
consumption should be prioritised not according to its GHG value, but with reference to its 
sustainable use. The LCFS provides a detailed list of an ex-ante hydrological on-site evaluation, 
which needs to be conducted before the CCS project is implemented. Among others, geologic and 
topographic maps as well as information on local basins, freshwater aquifers, water wells, and 
springs must be provided (CARB, 2018). The research institute Fraunhofer IEE developed an atlas for 
PtX potential42 in the form of a web-based GIS tool. In this spatial analysis, regions with high 
water stress were excluded from the regions with potential for PtX production. The underlying data 
are based on the Aqueduct Global Maps by the World Resources Institute (Fraunhofer IEE, 2021). Such 
tools facilitate the identification of suitable locations of elec- trolysers and prevent negative 
environmental impacts.

4.7 Social impact
In the EU, criteria covering the social impact are only implemented on a voluntary basis among 
Voluntary Schemes (e.g. ISCC, RSB). Common social criteria among the Voluntary Schemes are e.g. 
safe working condi- tions, compliance with human, labour and land rights, compliance with local 
laws and international treaties etc. To what extend those social criteria are harmonised among 
different Voluntary Schemes has been as- sessed by Mai-Moulin (2019). The harmonisation for “worker 
rights” among the Voluntary Schemes was as- sessed as high, whereas “human health impacts” and 
“compliance with local law rights & international trea- ties” were only harmonised on a medium 
level (Mai-Moulin et al., 2019). It can be expected that the social im- pact criteria – where they 
are already in place, e.g. within Voluntary Schemes or the UK RTFO, – will be trans- ferred to 
powerfuels as well.

5 Outlook on international certification

After examining existing standards and regulatory frameworks for renewable hydrogen, it becomes 
apparent that there are very different approaches in different regions of the world. The systems 
often agree on the es- sential points, however. With regard to the regulatory framework, the 
Californian LCFS, the European RED II and the UK RTFO, are the most advanced. The following section 
looks at commonalities of the analysed sys- tems and identifies where they deviate from one 
another. It determines challenges that remain to be solved in the implementation of global hydrogen 
trade.

5.1 Harmonisation possibilities of sustainability criteria
In order to be able to make a statement about how flexible renewable hydrogen quantities can be 
used within international trade and under fluctuating prices, the different sustainability 
requirements have to be compared and possibilities for harmonisation identified (Table 10). The 
most harmonised sustainability requirements are the use of renewable electricity inputs, mass 
balancing as the tracking model, GHG performance as well as the use of all carbon sources – as long 
as they are not deliberately produced for the synthetic fuel production.

The sustainable electricity criteria foreseen by RED II (additionality, temporal and geographical 
correlation) aim to reserve renewable electricity volumes for the electricity sector. CertifHy, the 
dena Biogasregister, as well as TÜV Süd will implement those criteria once they are implemented 
within national legislations. Water has been mentioned in H2Global, LCFS and RED II as a good that 
must be protected, but no specific sustainability criteria regarding water consumption has been 
formulated.

It is important to note, that production batches outside the geographical scope of the relevant 
regulatory standard must still comply with the prevailing criteria when imported into that specific 
territory. For example, renewable hydrogen from Chile must meet the RED II requirements to be able 
to enjoy state benefits and count towards the transport targets when imported to the EU.

5.2 Challenges for global harmonisation
For an all-encompassing global certification system, the requirements placed on the products would 
have to be harmonised. This concerns in particular the definition of renewable electricity and the 
definition of the sys- tem boundaries for the GHG calculation, as illustrated in Table 10. But is 
such a system desirable? What ad- vantages or disadvantages would it bring? For instance, would 
European market players and policy makers be willing to abandon the criteria which are meant to 
reserve the electricity first and foremost for the renewable electricity sector (additionality, 
temporal and geographical correlation) for the sake of having a globally har- monised certification 
scheme? For some regulations/standards, agreeing on the lowest common denominator would mean 
abandoning elaborate and ambitious requirements.

On a different note, when new structures are created or new issuing bodies are assigned, it also 
offers oppor- tunities to rethink the system from the ground up, bypassing the mistakes of past 
systems from the start. Table 10 gives an overview of existing renewable hydrogen regulations and 
standards.

In the case of global trade and the transfer of hydrogen quantities (or its derivatives) from one certification 
system to another, it must be ensured that the quantities in the sending register are cancelled, so that dou- 
ble/multiple counting (🡪 Glossary) does not occur.
For many of the illustrated challenges solutions are already available. They would only need to be 
coordinated and implemented. The differences in the system boundaries of GHG calculation 
methodologies could be overcome by setting up a modular system, for instance. The National 
University Australia, for example, pro- poses that each actor along the supply chain should take 
responsibility for the certification of its share. An added benefit of this approach would be that 
the party responsible for procuring the certification also has decision-making authority over that 
part of the supply chain. For example, a renewable hydrogen producer could certify the production 
and conversion modules. The producer sells hydrogen to an exporter, who would have additional 
responsibility for certifying the transport stage. This allows different national requirements for 
system boundaries to be covered, as standards may differ (White et al., 2021). For that, a common 
definition for renewable electricity is unavoidable.
A modular approach could also introduce different classes depending on the GHG emissions of the 
electricity sources, so that the certification of other products such as low-carbon hydrogen would 
also be possible. How- ever, mixing of certifications within one production unit must be avoided at 
all times. It must also be ensured that the accountability on transport targets (RED II, Art. 25) 
is maintained in order to benefit from state aid.
The physical traceability through mass balancing seems to benefit from a common agreement among the 
majority of the assessed regulations and standards. CertifHy has a Book & Claim system in place 
since it com- plies with Art. 19 RED II referring to GOs, not PoS. Nevertheless, a Book & Claim 
system would also have its advantages, especially in the ramp-up phase for hydrogen. It allows 
certificates to be traded separately from the physical product, thus allowing for more flexibility 
for producers as well as customers, increasing compe- tition intensity and resolving infrastructure 
issues like pipeline expansions. Any trading restrictions in form of physical transport obligations 
between individual countries might cause separate regional and less liquid mar- kets, which could 
further split the market into small submarkets. A system in which product and certificate can be 
traded independently would also reduce both transport costs and emissions. For some products, such 
as renewable ammonium or renewable kerosene, a global infrastructure is already in place. The 
danger of a delay in infrastructure development does not exist here, so that the application of the 
book & claim principles is more obvious here.





36

So far, however, mass balancing is required in all investigated regulatory frameworks (except for 
the Californian LCFS) in order to count the renewable hydrogen volumes towards national (transport) 
targets.
The different carbon sources (fossil-based industrial point source, biogenic and naturally 
occurring) have dif- ferent economic and environmental performances, which should be accounted for 
within the regulatory framework. The Global Alliance Powerfuels (2020) found that atmospheric 
carbon has a positive environmen- tal performance, but is significantly more expensive (300-600 
€/tCO2) than utilising other carbon sources. In the medium to long term, however, this cost should 
drop significantly. (Global Alliance Powerfuels, 2020). Those differences should be taken into 
account by the GHG calculation methodology of the standards/regula- tions.
The increased use of new digital technologies in form of emerging concepts such as the use of 
artificial intel- ligence or smart contracts, can strengthen the resilience of the system by 
keeping data secure and trustworthy, if implemented correctly. Intelligent use of digitalised 
platforms could even lower transaction costs and other barriers to participation in the global 
market for small-scale producers. Furthermore, the blockchain technol- ogy allows users from 
different parties to access a system, e.g. in form of a registry without violating ownership rights 
(Königsberger et al., 2020). In addition, the potential for scalability of the technology for a 
more precise tracing of the hydrogen volumes is an advantage of the blockchain technology. 
Obstacles of the blockchain technology are limited trust and experience of system/registry 
operators, the slowness of the energy sector to adapt to blockchain technology, insecurities about 
implementation costs and the requirement of highly trained staff of certification schemes 
(Königsberger et al., 2020). The openness towards new technologies such as blockchain could, 
however, be offset by demonstrating the feasibility of such a solution in pilot projects. Several 
projects currently involve well-known energy market players cooperating with start-ups that are 
test- ing or even operating a certification solution based on the distributed ledger technology 
(DLT). For instance, GreenH2chain – operated by ACCIONA and FlexiDAO (ACCIONA, 2021) – is 
developing a blockchain-based plat- form to track and prove the sustainable origin of renewable 
hydrogen. Also, a cooperation between Engie and Ledger is currently developing a blockchain 
hardware device for securing data at the source of the energy pro- duction and transferring it to a 
decentralized system (Engie, 2018). The project EnergyTag, involving Eneco, FlexiDao and CertiQ, 
establishes a platform for daily matching of electricity volumes, supporting the transac- tional 
process by trading renewable energy certificates provided by Power Ledger (Power Ledger, 2020).
Moreover, it is important to be aware of the implications of applying sustainability criteria to 
the degree of sustainability of hydrogen. For instance, if the qualification as renewable hydrogen 
is only based on the can- cellation of GOs, then the specification of the GO becomes relevant for 
whether truly renewable hydrogen was produced or whether a kind of green washing took place.
With regard to a uniform certification system, it is also important to investigate to what extent 
criteria should be differentiated regionally depending on the country of production. This is, among 
other, relevant for water consumption criteria as well as criteria regarding the renewable 
electricity consumption. Here, the explicit re- quirements in the EU regarding the priority of 
renewable electricity for direct power applications ultimately reflects the regional / local 
problem that in many European countries coal-fired power generation still repre- sents a 
significant part of the overall energy mix. It is essential to lift the targets for the expansion 
of renewable energies to consider the increased demand for renewable hydrogen - and to initiate the 
construction of new plants as quickly as possible.
Based on this, it would not make sense to apply the same criteria to all countries. A new system 
designed on the blank page could introduce potential new aspects to ensure the sustainability of 
the systems, however,





„Harmonisation of Hydrogen Certification“  37

disproportionate complexity and additional (administrative) burdens should be avoided, as this 
would hamper the market ramp-up of renewable hydrogen already in the early stage. An example for 
new aspects to be cov- ered could be a more explicit criterion on water consumption could 
contribute to this goal. Sailer et al. (2021) propose to implement a water consumption threshold in 
form of a water efficiency criteria [l/kWh hydrogen output]. The stoichiometric – i.e. optimum – 
amount of water required to produce one cubic meter of hydrogen amounts to 0.81 litres (or 8.92 
litres to produce 1 kg of hydrogen). However, the amount of water required in practice is usually 
25% higher (Barbir, 2005) – a water efficiency threshold would thus help to avoid unneces- sary 
excessive water consumption. Since water stress looks different in different regions of the world, 
this threshold value should be based on a water stress map to avoid excessive water consumption. 
Such a criterion would be especially crucial for hydrogen production in arid regions such as MENA. 
In addition to a water effi- ciency criterion, the Global Alliance Powerfuels (2021) suggests to 
require operators of renewable hydrogen production plants to demonstrate ex-ante, based on data on 
water consumption and availability at regional level, that the electrolyser does not increase the 
risk of declining water levels or negatively affects the existing water supply. This could be based 
on existing administrative subdivisions, e.g. corresponding to population sizes of approximately 
1-3 million. The World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas contains global data on 
water consumption and availability for regions at this level. Before the installation is 
implemented, it could also be made mandatory for operators to conduct in advance an evaluation of 
the hydrological condition of the construction site implemented (California Energy Commission and 
California Natural Resources Agency, 2018), which could be audited as part of the certification 
process.
Social impact criteria hold companies accountable to, for example, worker’s rights such as the ILO 
standard, which usually only governments are bound to. However, if social criteria are integrated 
into the hydrogen standard, companies are also obliged to comply with them. Adherence to social 
justice makes transnational cooperation and global supply chains more trustworthy for business 
partners and end customers.
Finally, the different developments and specific problems that are currently being dealt with in 
the various countries might constitute the greatest challenge today. This includes the different 
stages of development re- garding certification of renewable electricity, but also covers the 
differences in national hydrogen strategies with wide ranges of expected demand for hydrogen in the 
upcoming years, as well as the diverging sizes and development stages of hydrogen projects.

production and in which markets they can sell the energy carrier best. Instead of speculating that 
there will be a globally har- monised certification system for renewable hydrogen, the problem can 
be solved in another way: A plant con- cept that complies with the requirements of all (or at least 
most) regulatory frameworks, as depicted in Figure
3. This plant concept guarantees the largest addressable market for renewable hydrogen quantities. 
In doing so, it excludes the purchase of electricity via the grid, as this is where the greatest 
differences between the various standards occur. The exclusion of the grid connection in the plant 
concept in Figure 3 is carried out only based on the fact that the standards differ most in the 
criteria of the grid connection. The heterogeneity of the various hydrogen standards around the 
world can therefore be avoided by a system concept with direct con- nection. However, this does not 
mean that hydrogen production is less sustainable with a grid connection.
For the GHG reduction, the EU target was taken instead of the more ambitious TÜV Süd target, since 
the TÜV standard is market-based and does not, for instance, grant any state aid.
A plant concept addressing the largest global offtake market*:
1. Direct connection between the renewable power source and the electrolyser
2.  GHG reduction of 70% (target value: 28.2 gCO2equ/MJ) compared to a fossil baseline of 94,1 
gCO2equ/MJ
3. Carbon source: Atmospheric (DAC)
*Proof for mass balance needs to be provided along the value chain

This plant concept merely specifies how hydrogen quantities can be produced that can be sold 
worldwide as renewable. However, it does not imply that these criteria should be adopted in the 
regulatory framework, as

they would lead to severe obstacles to the market ramp-up of hydrogen due to the high production 
costs. Therefore, it does not constitute a target vision, but a theoretical compromise for the 
current lack of the har- monisation potential of global standards.


Further plant concepts and their eligibility for certain markets
As an alternative to the illustrated concept above, which complies with all hydrogen 
standards/regulations globally, global requirements for renewable hydrogen and the necessary 
certification also allow for other plant concepts. For a large part of the market leaner plant 
concepts would also satisfy the existing criteria for renew- able hydrogen. Certification schemes 
in China, Japan and California/USA, for instance, allow the use of elec- tricity from the grid. 
Table 11 shows different plant concepts and the respective hydrogen standard/regulations they 
comply with.

6 Conclusion

This paper assesses the potential for harmonising global hydrogen regulations and standards in 
order to create an all-encompassing global certification system for renewable hydrogen and its 
derivatives. One of the findings of the analysis of eleven standards/regulatory frameworks 
worldwide is that the most harmonised sustainabi- lity requirements are the use of renewable 
electricity inputs, mass balancing as the tracking model as well as the eligibility of all carbon 
sources, as long as they are not deliberately produced for the generation of hydrogen or its 
derivatives.
In the end, this paper draws the conclusion that a global certification scheme for renewable 
hydrogen will be challenging to achieve. For some standards/regulations it would mean to give up on 
the most ambitious re- quirements regarding the production of renewable hydrogen – such as the EU’s 
renewable electricity criteria according to Art 27. RED II, which are currently valid only for the 
transport sector, but shall be enlarged to the industry, heating and cooling as well with the 
revision of the legislation. Thereupon, the paper shows a theo- retical plant concept for the 
production of renewable hydrogen, which is recognised among all eleven hydro- gen 
regulations/standards assessed. It is based on a direct connection between the electrolyser and the 
re- newable electricity plant, a 70% GHG reduction of the produced hydrogen compared to the 
reference value of 94 gCO2equ/MJ, and the use of atmospheric carbon from DAC. This concept is not a 
target framework. It is solely based on the fact that the standards/regulations differ most in the 
criteria of the grid connection. The hetero- geneity of the various hydrogen standards around the 
world can therefore be avoided by a system concept with direct connection. However, this does not 
mean that hydrogen production is less sustainable with a grid connection. The chain of custody must 
be traced by mass balancing, a tracking model where the physical de- livery of an energy carrier 
goes hand in hand with the certificate. By fulfilling these criteria, producers would gain access 
to all analysed markets.
In order to be able to withdraw renewable hydrogen volumes from this plant concept and to place it 
on all markets, the following aspects for the global use/tradability of certificates are pivotal:
-  Global recognition of certification bodies in order to conduct the audits: In order for 
certification bod- ies to conduct audits concerning standard compliance, they must be officially 
recognised by a com- petent authority. E.g., TÜV Süd as a certification body for the EU market can 
only conduct plant audits for the British market according to the RTFO as well, if TÜV Süd is 
officially recognised by the UK’s Department for Transport. Thus, to foster the global 
harmonisation of certification, global recognition of certification bodies by the respective 
competent bodies of the various markets is required to enable the conduction of the audits.
-  Reliability and trust towards hydrogen standards, certification schemes, certification bodies of 
differ- ent markets.
-  Robust mechanisms for avoidance of double counting/claims. When transferring hydrogen quantities 
(or its derivatives) from one certification system to another, it must be ensured, for example, 
that the quantities in the sending register are cancelled.
-  Certificates from different schemes must be comparable and recognised on different markets (e.g. 
standardised data fields). To give an example: The harmonisation of data field names on the 
certificate creates a common language among markets which facilitates the verification of target 
compliance. It also ensures that stakeholders talk about the same thing when referring to a 
specific term.





„Harmonisation of Hydrogen Certification“  41

-  Harmonisation of the certification governance: At the moment, different certification structures 
re- garding the application process, certification bodies and data handling are in place in 
different regions of the world (Chapter 3). One global certification standard is required with 
regard to the general certi- fication governance, which sets the rules on certificate handling and 
the process of official recognition by a competent authority.
-  Openness to other standards: Recognition of other standards among certification schemes.
It is important to note, that different requirements for the generation of renewable hydrogen go 
hand in hand with different production costs and availability of hydrogen and its derivatives. The 
hydrogen production costs of the plant concept above are, therefore, relatively high. Thus, this 
analysis offers an overview of alternative plant concepts and the respective hydrogen 
standards/regulations they comply with. For a large part of the assessed markets, leaner plant 
concepts would also satisfy the existing criteria for renewable hydrogen. For instance, 
certification schemes in China, Japan and California/USA allow the use of electricity from the 
grid.
In the end, it is likely that the European standard set by the RED II – despite its high ambition – 
will prevail, as the market is driven by significant political incentives due to the currently 
still high hydrogen production costs. With its regulatory conditions and the associated support 
instruments for market take-up, the EU has created an incentive for the production of renewable 
hydrogen that is particularly attractive to market players around the world. However, although the 
EU is considered an international role model in terms of standard-setting, a global hydrogen market 
could also be characterised by other conditions.
The EU is perceived primarily as a large (future) consumer of renewable hydrogen. Nevertheless, if 
the regula- tory conditions prove to be too strict, there is a risk that large hydrogen producers 
will opt for other certification or sales markets altogether and the EU market becomes less 
attractive in the long-term. This development would be contrary to the EU's ambition to strengthen 
its leadership in the hydrogen economy in terms of tech- nical standards, regulations and 
definitions on hydrogen, as defined in the EU’s hydrogen strategy. Policymak- ers should therefore 
ensure that an EU-wide hydrogen regulatory framework does not hinder trade and market development 
for renewable hydrogen in the end.
