Peru and Germany are global allies with shared 
principles and strong ties in the field of  

cooperation and environmental protection. 
This has enabled Peru to be one of Germany's  

global partners in Latin America. 
And we will ask to continue promoting  

our workforce cooperation based on 
the implementation of those goals. 
 

As a country committed to cleaner energy 
transition, we are meaningful of the importance  

of international cooperation to achieve that 
end through the expansion of electromobility,  

transport and use of green ?? the 
creation of energy schools for women,  

among other strategies. International cooperation 
for the global energy transition is on the rise.  

Complimented by a growing bilateral 
commitment to foster international learning  

and exchange of experiences. Despite this, we are 
still far from achieving sustainable development  

of the 2030 agenda focused on ensuring access to 
affordable, reliable, and modern energy for all. 
 

For Peru, our immense potential in renewable 
energy allows us to build up a market that  

eases our transition to green energy. We hope 
that this will ensure new jobs and investment  

while benefitting the population by increasing 
economic competitiveness and lowering price.
