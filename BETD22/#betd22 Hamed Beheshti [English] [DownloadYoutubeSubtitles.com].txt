and i'm very pleased to introduce to you dr 
ahmed bahashti the founder of the off-grid water  

alliance welcome thank you pleasure pleasure it is 
such a pleasure to have you today with us thanks  

um i know that we are going to get ready for a 
lot more coming for you um our digital audience  

and our live audience so i want to get right into 
some questions for you now you've spent the last  

20 years of career of your career working on solar 
and water projects across the globe you've now  

founded the off-grid water alliance which is a new 
initiative meant to bring a voice to the sector  

at the global stage there are already several 
water and energy alliances and councils around  

the world why do we need a new one the reason to 
have a new one is there are other alliances there  

are other organizations all over the world there 
are water organizations and then from the water  

organization you have energy organizations energy 
events conferences not all of them are focusing  

on the issue of the combination of water and 
energy at the same time and focusing on remote  

part of the planet on off-grid communities we 
wanted to have an alliance focusing on these two  

together the sdg-6 and sdg-7 meat so where water 
meets electricity water means renewables in the  

remotest part of the planet from one side and an 
off-grid community in general from the other side  

thank you so much now i wanted to ask you what 
does off-grid mean in practice are we just  

talking about rural villages not necessary not 
at all off-grid means a place where electricity  

lines are there but there is no electricity in it 
you can't imagine there are plenty of different  

parts of the world that electricity lines are 
there not necessarily electricity in or there  

is no electricity line there is no grid again that 
place is upgrade or there is the electricity grid  

people would not afford paying for electricity 
again that means upgrade when you do not have  

access to that electricity you cannot have the 
access to it again you are upgrade the last  

but the most let's say famous form of upgrade is 
absolute remote part of the planet where there  

is no grid when where people do not afford 
even having a diesel engine or whatever for  

their electricity supply this is the definition in 
this definition many of the poor urban communities  

many of these satellite cities around capitals in 
developing countries they are all called afghan  

communities not necessary villages that's an 
important point to make absolutely absolutely  

and it's a big misunderstanding when we talk 
about off-grid people think okay you are in  

rural you are in villages we are in urban that's 
not true it's as we heard in that last panel it  

is going to take all of us so i've got another 
question for you where's the alliance going to be  

heading amid the global security challenges that 
we're facing right now we have to take of course  

ukraine as an example where can we put water into 
the energy transition dialogue and i'll ask you to  

keep your mic a little bit closer sure uh with 
all these challenges the unfortunate growing  

challenges of security around the world 
we see wherever the securities challenge  

the issue of electricity the issue of water is 
also growing this is what we see in the role of  

the of good water alliance to brings its services 
to the places to the war zones or to the places  

whatever challenges that is growing there either 
is a security you should like a war now in ukraine  

or any other drought cases that now we have in 
east africa in the energy transition dialogue  

what the alliance tries to highlight and bring a 
voice to the entire sect for the entire sector to  

the world is look energy transition is not just 
an urban entity it's not just an urban notion  

energy transition should cover the entire world we 
are talking about the entire planet so we should  

not just talk about the urban communities where we 
let the developing countries we let the off-grid  

communities do not pave the same exact path that 
we have paved in the past decades or centuries  

we can bring other opportunities to them 
developing themselves in a more sustainable  

way so off-grid water alliance can play an 
strategic role in term of the in term of energy  

transition to help off-grid communities develop 
more sustainably and develop the way that again  

they have their own voice they have their 
own school they have their own title in the  

development and they would not be ignored in many 
of our energy transition dialogues we see that  

less of access let's have a stage we are bringing 
to those that are traditionally voiceless that's  

true and i'm happy that you bring up the idea of 
access we're going to be looking and come some  

more panels later today and tomorrow at access 
we're also going to be looking at the role that  

water is going to play for us um we still have 
about another 30 seconds i'd like to ask you for a  

final comment dr hamid bahashti pleasure the final 
comments i can bring to the entire stage here in  

this transition is again the same issue that be 
careful energy transition should not just be for  

urban communities uh off-grid communities rural 
communities poor urban communities they should  

be all part of this game and we hope off-grid 
water alliance where stg6 and sdg7 is meeting  

brings the voice of the sector of those with 
solution for those communities thank you so much.
