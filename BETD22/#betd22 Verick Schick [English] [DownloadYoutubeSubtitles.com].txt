i'd now like to introduce very sick from the 
agency for business and economic development  

welcome thank you so much for joining me 
thank you thank you for being here it's  

such a pleasure to have two guests on this 
final studio session of this morning now as  

an energy expert for the agency for business 
and economic development you advise companies  

about the private sector could you tell us a 
little bit more about this initiative yes so  

the agency for business and economic development 
acts on behalf of the german federal ministry  

for economic cooperation and development bmz we 
are a central point of contact and our mission  

is to advise companies from the private 
sector on investments in developing  

countries developing and of course emerging 
countries we provide confidential cost-free  

and expert advice on promotional programs and 
financing solutions of the german development  

corporation briefly why we do that because our 
belief is that companies create sustainable jobs  

these jobs then add to state income by for 
example additional tax export revenues even  

and that additional income can then be used for 
infrastructure investments we are talking about  

infrastructure here so for example that would 
be also a possibility so all in all that is  

an upward spiral for development and that is 
why there's a strong overlap with the german  

development corporation and that is why 
also why the german development corporation  

exactly supports these kinds of initiatives 
and in order to to professionally execute that  

mission experts from gis deutsche gesellschaft 
international artist zamabite and from kfwdg  

which is the deutsche investitions and wikileaks 
have been seconded to the agency now i want to  

know a little bit what the agency for business 
and economic development might offer to private  

companies so actually what we do is we support 
them in seizing market opportunities and we  

do that by providing information by providing 
advisory services and also by creating linkages  

all focused on promotion programs and financing 
solutions we request a retreat requests  

confidentially we treat them free of cost 
and also through a company's perspective  

and of course we not only work in energy 
but also in different other sectors now is  

there anything else that companies can expect 
when they contact you we have a decent coffee  

coffee is always good so but besides coffee and 
also besides information advisory services and  

creation or initiation of cooperation 
possibilities with the german development  

corporation companies for example 
german companies can expect legal advice  

and expert advice on legal requirements and 
managerial requirements for german companies  

concerning the new law on due diligence and human 
rights in german you say zorgfeldt's gazettes and  

another service is for example a program called 
bridging the gap where companies are supported  

and are prepared to successfully participate 
in tenders of international development banks  

like for example the asian development bank i 
wanted to ask before we go into our lunch break  

if you have any final thoughts any final comments 
um actually um i really like that initiative um
