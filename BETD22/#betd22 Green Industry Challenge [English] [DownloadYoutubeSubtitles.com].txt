The global community faces immense challenges 
of climate change. International cooperation  

for sustainable change is more essential 
than ever. To achieve climate neutrality,  

we need to rethink. This also includes our 
industries which produce more than 24.2% of the  

world's greenhouse gas emissions. As an initiative 
of the Berlin Energy Transition Dialogue, the  

Green Industry Challenge aims to find innovative 
policy and technical?based solutions to strengthen  

international cooperation in the energy sector for 
sustainable change, based on renewable energy. 
 

Worldwide, industries and entire supply chains 
are required to undergo enormous changes in order  

to develop sustainable production purposes for 
the long term. Therefore, this year's challenge  

aims to discover and encourage innovative 
ideas to decarbonise the global industry.  

Let's find new, creative, and innovative 
policy and technical?based solutions  

to make decarbonisation a 
reality in the energy sector.  

Ideas for the challenge can come from a variety of 
areas. For example, renewable energy production.  

Green hydrogen. Renewable heating/cooling. Battery 
technologies. It's worth applying. Winners will  

be invited to the next Berlin Energy Transition 
Dialogue to present their sustainable solutions  

in front of international, high?level 
stakeholders, and political representatives. 
 

Additionally, winners will receive mentoring and 
will be able to network to expand their ideas.  

And both finalists and winners will be chosen 
by an international jury composed of diverse,  

high?level members of the energy community. How 
can your ideas contribute to decarbonisation and  

climate?neutral industry? Apply 
now to join the challenge.
