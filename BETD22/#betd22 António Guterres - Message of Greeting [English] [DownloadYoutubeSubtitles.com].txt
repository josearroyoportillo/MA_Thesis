Minister Baerbock, dear friends, I commend the 
German government for hosting the Berlin Energy  

Transition Dialogue, your leadership is essential. 
We need to fix the broken global energy mix.  

To limit global temperature rise to 1.5 
degrees, the world requires a 45% reduction  

in emissions by 2030, and carbon neutrality by 
mid-century. We are far off track. Last year,  

global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions 
grew by 6 appears when they should be falling.  

In fact, with current national commitments, 
emissions are projected to increase by almost 14%  

these decades. Our planet has already warmed by as 
much as 1.2 degrees, and we see the increasingly  

devastating consequences everywhere. So how do you 
keep 1.5 alive? By accelerating the phase-out of  

coal and all fossil fuels and rapidly increasing 
the use of renewable energy. The emerging  

economies must do more to lead - including helping 
emerging economies to a rapid energy transition,  

means using our innovation using the right 
mechanisms, including financial instruments,  

to promote the transformation we need. We must 
discourage and end public sector financing  

for coal. Coal emissions have surged to 
record highs. Coal and fossil fuels are  

futile investments that will lead to billions 
of dollars in stranded assets. It is also time  

to end fossil fuel subsidies and stop the 
expansion of oil and gas exploration. The  

current crisis shows we must accelerate and 
not slow the renewable energy transition.  

This is the only true path to energy security, 
and I count on you to lead the way. Thank you.
