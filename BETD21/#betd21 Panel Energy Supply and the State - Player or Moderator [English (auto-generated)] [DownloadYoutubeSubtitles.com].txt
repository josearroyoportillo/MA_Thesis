the name of our session is

energy supply in the state player or

moderator

in this session we're going to take a

look at the question of the public

sector's role in facilitating and

driving the green energy transition

towards climate neutrality

before i introduce our esteemed

panelists i'd like to give a little

brief overview of how this session is

going to run today

we'll of course have an opportunity for

our audience to participate you can

submit chats there in our online

platform

and your questions of course and after

two rounds of questions

we will conclude with a statement by

gaurie singh

right now though i would like to take a

moment to introduce our various team

panelists we've got about 30 minutes for

this panel as melinda said so i'll be

sure to keep these intros

brief joining me today are fatigue

minister of the ministry of energy in

turkey majid madi hantouch

minister of electricity for iraq galrie

singh the deputy

director general of irena dr angela

wilkinson

secretary general and ceo of the world

energy council

and christelle frastraten senior

director for european policy

at chargepoint ladies and gentlemen

welcome it's such a pleasure to have you

all with us today

um i would like to start though with a

quick question

for our audience members and that means

audience it's your turn to take a look

at our slido channel

here we go this is a multiple choice

question who should lead

the global energy transition here are

your options

international organizations nation

states citizens

the private sector or everyone together

as your answers come in we will go ahead

and

move to our panelists and as a reminder

to our panelists

please try to keep your responses to

three minutes or fewer

i'd like to start off first with a

question for minister dunmes

minister durmez can you please give us

an introduction

on the role of state and public sector

in the formulation of

national energy transition policies and

the implementation of these policy

frameworks

with the main economic and societal

actors

hello everybody thank you miss porto

distinguished and distinguished

participants

ladies and gentlemen beginning my words

i would like to thank to the german

federal government

for hosting this virtual conference

during this challenging times

last year was a very difficult period

for all of us

during this period energy supply

security

has consolidated its place

as the top priority in the energy

policies of

countries needless to say

to secure supply maintain stability

and resilience of markets as well as

continuity of investments are

important tools even at these times

continuation of implementation of the

energy transition policies

is very encouraging

energy transition is not only a

transition of

fields but a transition of

institutions markets

market players and consumers

so it sounds simple but it is a complex

challenge the burden of this transition

is

on government's shoulders

public sector is responsible for the

establishment of a sound reliable

and predictable investment environment

for investors

by setting up this by setting up the

policies legislation and

incentives according to the

needs and priorities with this

regard our three-part approach consists

of

enable innovate and communicate

first one is enable grid

legislation and system security

should enable maximum utilization of

renewables for example in turkey

we have practically zero curtailment for

renewables

second one is innovate private sector

involvement alongside increasing their

share of startups

is important to accelerate energy

transition

since the process is complicated

more result-oriented pilot projects

are a must

as turkey we will finance

pilot storage projects in all our

distribution regions

to eliminate the storage challenges

stemming from increasing renewables

and the last one is communicate

as a game setter and facilitator

governments establish the main policy

framework

in coordination and consultation with

all

the stakeholders including ngos

financial institutions and private

sector

without parts participation of different

stakeholders

realization of the policies with regard

to

transition projects would be very

difficult

this shows the significance of the

establishment

of collaboration and harmony between

public and private sector both at

national and international levels

concluding my speech i hope that

next year we can have a face-to-face

meeting

thank you very much goodbye

thank you minister dunmez we also hope

that next year will allow for

face-to-face interactions thank you very

much for your contributions today

ladies and gentlemen we're having a

couple of technical issues on our side

and i've received word that minister

hantous

is not yet with us so i'd like to go

ahead and address my next question to ms

singh

hello welcome for thank you for joining

us today i wanted to ask you irina

directly collaborates with more than 160

nation states from all over the world

on renewable energy policies could you

please give us a short introduction into

the role

of the state in the fir in further

accelerating global energy transitions

thank you so much for having me on this

very important

panel at the berlin energy transition

dialogue

and i i just want to

take further what minister don miz has

said

and you know go on to say that

last year was a very challenging year

but it also

threw up opportunities for countries to

rethink

what their energy systems could look

like in the future

irena has yesterday it it launched

a preview to the world

energy transitions outlook and

one of the things that we've said there

is

that there is a very short window of

opportunity

but energy transitions are are happening

they are unstoppable

and they are possible with the

technologies

that are proven technologies uh and are

also technologies which are cost

competitive now

uh if if i look at uh um you know some

of the findings that we had

in uh from this report and i'll just

spend a minute

on it um 90 of the decarbonization by

2050 will involve

renewables through low cost power energy

efficiency

electrification bio energy with ccs

and green hydrogen so what what we

do see is that although the window of

opportunity

is is really tight and small but

there are proven technologies with us

that can help us move along this path

that would

keep the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees

and also allow the world to reach

carbon neutrality at in 2050.

now how how how are the states involved

so this is not

uh as the minister pointed out it's it's

it's a very complex uh

uh issue of coordination and also

what we look at governments these are

not monoliths

these are a complex uh structure of

multiple institutions which all behave

very differently

so the unless the government send

a very strong signal which

allows the private sector to

to know that all the uh the

the pieces uh in in the coordination

are actually coming together as a whole

the investments don't

unlock and if here to move

on this very you know it's an ambitious

pathway but it's it's doable

it needs to unlock investments to the

tune of almost 4.4

um us dollar 4.4 trillion u.s dollars

on an annual basis and if you're looking

at where we are today we have uh

we have investments of about 1.8

uh trillion dollars so it's it's really

doubling or more than doubling

so this these are things that are only

possible

with the right signals coming uh with

aligned policies and regulations which

can

unlock um unlock the markets and

strengthen the

the flows that are already happening in

the financial

sector that we saw last year where

the clean energy stocks are are

obviously doing well

so it's it's a there is a momentum

that's created

and with the right uh signals and the

policy

initiatives it can actually uh allow us

to move

more rapidly into the energy transition

for the countries thank you thank you

missing some interesting news from

irena's

deputy director general i'd like to turn

now to dr wilkinson

dr wilkinson the world energy council

has membership in

nearly 100 geographies and produces a

number of well-known insights studies

and reports

what can you tell us today from recent

conversations that you've had with

your membership and your field data

about the pace

of the energy transition thank you

jennifer and

thank you to the berlin energy

transition dialogue excellencies ladies

and gentlemen i'm delighted to join you

today

and share some new insights i agree

with the minister that government has a

huge

enabling role to play and i also

congratulate

irina for their report today yesterday

and

i was particularly excited about the

socioeconomic impacts

um flavor to the report i have been

banging on about

humanizing energy for a year and a half

now and i'm pleased to see that this is

being picked up

from our field research let me just

share a couple

of um of nuggets we have been conducting

regular surveys

on the impacts of the kovic crisis and

the

recovery planning that's going on our

most recent survey

of the covid 19 reveals that there is a

big gap between what customers are doing

and what customers need to be doing to

enable successful global energy

transition so this brings us down to the

challenges

of regulatory policies which

are not just coherent but also involves

people and the impacts of people in

transition

and from today we launched our 13th

world energy issues monitor

and we've been tracking the 25 different

issues associated with energy transition

for over a decade

and that just one highlight from that

is that we have seen a new emphasis on

the challenges

of affordability an increase in this as

an

action priority particularly in the post

pandemic

context of affordability and the rise of

energy justice issues in all geographies

so

the state has a really important

enabling role

but implementation is not going to be

manageable

unless we really take into account these

socioeconomic impacts

and manage the affordability and the

justice matters

that have emerged in the covered crisis

let me stop there for now

thank you very much dr wilson todd

wilkinson my apologies

talking about socio-economic impacts and

affordability

my next question is for miss festraten

from your perspective uh as a

representative of a leading e-mobility

power charging company standing at the

brink of mass e-mobility markets

how can states prepare facilitate and

accelerate the upcoming mass-market

expansion of sustainable green

e-mobility

uh what about current initiatives also

of the eu and

implications for member states

well uh first of all let me thank you as

well uh the organizers for having us and

having me today on this very

distinguished panel it's a great

privilege for me

um so yes indeed i think mobility is a

great example

of uh of to illustrate uh these

questions

um chargepoint is a as a long-standing

uh

provider for electric vehicle charging

infrastructure solutions

uh 12 have experienced 12 years

experience in the us and now more than

four in europe

and what we have noticed from that

experience is that as it has been

already said

the states and the policies are really

instrumental

to at least set the right framework to

drive those investments happening

and since um uh today these days with

with this conference we're really trying

to articulate

how the energy transition should happen

i think uh

starting from the beginning the state

can really help to implement

the right market designs to provide the

electricity supply and in particular

the renewable and the green electricity

to power the cars

first of all um but also setting the

right

legislation and the right mandates to

provide the vehicles on the road i think

um to your second question um in europe

we have a very good example on how for

example the cs2 test

the co2 standards regulation for the new

vehicles

for the cars but also for the heavy duty

has really helped to

for the car industry to deploy and

develop the models which are now

becoming available and more affordable

also

uh for uh for everyone so i think this

is a very good example but without that

it would have been a little bit more

difficult to understand how the market

would evolve and get the predictability

of this market and last but not least

um looking more at the deployment of the

charging infrastructure network

uh well again here it's all about

integrating the different policies right

it's to understand first where

what are the targets what's the vision i

think

again the european commission in our

case has given a very clear mandate

about the decarbonization of transport

setting up targets to deploy

the charging network but actually it's

really beyond that it's really about

setting as i was saying earlier the

right

market condition to make sure that these

investments happen

and we have a very good momentum now in

brussels happening

with the fit for a 55 package coming up

uh in june which is all about these uh

proposals

uh starting with the revision of the

alternative fuel infrastructure

directive but also the renewables

directive that has actually an

obligation

uh for uh renewables fuels um the

renewables the revision sorry of the

energy performance of buildings

directive i mean

as you may see there are many pieces of

legislation that needs to be coordinated

to just make it happen

and that's where the states and the

government can help to have

and develop this integrated approach

thank you mr festraten talking about an

integrated approach uh

i'd like now to go to our audience poll

responses

remember the question was who should

lead the global energy transition and in

a moment you'll see

about half of you said all together

followed very closely though

by nation states and i want to think

about the

other respondents as i ask my next

question which we're moving on to our

second round of questions and i'll ask

this question to dr wilkinson given that

large multinationals are among the

largest direct and indirect

greenhouse gas emitters today with some

notorious

with some notorious for greenwashing csr

activities

how can multinational corporations

henceforth contribute effectively

and in a binding manner to the emissions

goals set by the paris agreement from

2015.

dr wilkinson

right well the reality is that investors

and corporations are working hand in

hand you can't scale up these new

technologies without the incumbent

market players also

playing a part in taking them to scale

um from the world energy council

perspective we try to avoid this

polarization between

heroes and villains in energy transition

and try and think of what's the

constructive role for everybody

taking a seat at the table everybody

needs to play a part in this transition

that's what your paul reveals

all of us are going to have to be part

of the leadership on this

and the um the investor community has

been using the

enviro what's called the environmental

social and governance risk framework

to allocate its decision it's its

capital allocation

but it's also important that governments

play a role on behalf of the public

sector here

because we know that capital markets can

focus on short-term returns and we

really do have to ensure that

the infrastructure that is required to

support

all the activities for the energy system

is effectively

planned for and paid for and paid for in

a way where there's a fair sharing of

who benefits from the new or existing

infrastructures

and who is being stranded or losing

from the change in the system and the

state needs to play a role in that so

i wouldn't see it as a good versus bad

there are no winners in the race to zero

we've got to get

billions more people with the energy for

livelihoods

lifestyles and even luxuries and as your

whole shows

we all can play a part

play a part thank you very much dr

wilkinson i have another question uh for

ms freshgratin

uh my question for you concerns the

adoption dynamics by multinationals in

the sector of

e-mobility so what is your experience so

far

and what are the expectations for

corporate car fleets and e-logistics

and furthermore how can states

dramatically accelerate the adoption of

immobile

lifestyles by the younger generations

and i'm talking about more than just

those e-scooters you see out on the

streets

oh sure uh well first on your first

question

uh yes uh definitely we do see really

an uptake off the market at the

different use case level i would say

um certainly at fleet and logistics

level

also because um on top of contributing

to

a decarbonization um of the transport

target um it also makes sense

economically right

i mean particularly for that segment i

mean if you consider

a fleet of vehicles um either last by

delivery

or larger truck but even probably uh

tnc's they all have

very different um uh patterns

of behavior of using the cars or the

vehicles but at the end there is always

a certain time and moment

when these vehicles needs to charge and

potentially also becomes a source of

flexibility

to the energy system that can be

rewarded with the right

electricity market design in place and

so either it's a way to just

manage the load in terms of integrated

more renewables for example

but it can also become the storage

capacity

and potentially re-inject part of that

electricity into

um into the grid so i would say that

um there are many advantages uh for the

fleet sector in the logistics sector it

turns to um electro mobility

and it's all about again having the

right framework in place to make sure

that it's just easy to implement

maybe a very last word regarding the

deployment of the charging

infrastructure because it all goes hand

in hand

it's important indeed to really address

the user needs

and the charging patterns otherwise you

might get it wrong

and therefore it's not it's not worth

trying it

um on your ladder on your on your last

question we are less involved in that

aspect but

the way i i perceive that it's really

more about

uh developing the right framework for um

the mobility as

a service right it needs to be easy for

the user

uh to just uh use all these new mobility

services that are available

either at city level but also uh beyond

uh i mean in large countries it's all it

should be easy to commute

from a more remote location and and

being able to use different means of

transport and this is more about really

developing a comprehensive offer for um

what we call mass so mobility as a

service and it probably needs to be

developed

in conjunction by the different players

so the authorities the users

and those who can offer those mobility

services

thank you very much miss fresh stratton

uh i want to make sure we leave enough

time

to get back to our final statements uh

but we have

had an audience question come in that

actually means a lot to me

it talks about the energy disruptions

that we just saw

in the state of texas in the united

states

and if the result of those those

interruptions because of extreme cold

weather if

they'll make an impact towards a

climate-friendly energy transition

we have just a couple of minutes for

this question and i would like to open

the floor to see

which of our panelists would like to

respond to this

if you are ready to talk please go ahead

and do so

okay then let me throw something in

jennifer just from the reflections that

we've had in our

our community so you know we're a

bottom-up community so these are not

filtered or edited what's very

interesting around the

the texas case is the cultural aspects

of choices

around energy systems design that the

texas grid is

independent of all the other parts of

the state and

we want in energy transition to think

about the most

cooperative solutions moving forward and

regionally pooled grids and regionally

pooled pipelines

and enabling molecules and electrons

clean both of them

is very important but the texas case i

think shows us that our regulatory

frameworks

aren't up to the job and that culture is

a big part

of energy transition pathways so this is

why we have

i'm sorry i think that we have

unfortunately lost

dr wilkinson's feed we'll see if we can

come back to her but for right now i

would like to

go to ms singh um

and i have a final question for miss

singh thank you for your patience

generally speaking what can be done to

help nation states with these

complex multilateral implementation

processes and more specifically

those that are lagging behind the fast

evolving energy transition trends and

policy targets

ms singh so um

you know as as we've just heard energy

transition

is not about just uh having the

transition happening in technology or in

terms of the planning

and projections it's uh it's also

a social transition a social dynamic

that comes into play

when you're talking about energy

transition uh our analysis has

said that we have almost uh 30 million

uh workers in the whole segment for

example

which when we when we look at

the coal segment going down we

definitely will have issues around how

to re-skill them and how to

help them adapt to the new circumstances

so

there are a variety of very complex

issues that need to be

dealt with and i have seen

in my experience uh when you get policy

makers together

and and we see it regularly happening at

the irena assembly

and have uh have them actually speak to

each other about their experience

that's when the maximum learning happens

it it allows the policy makers to

understand that they're not alone in

this

in this very complex

set of events and also allows them to

understand what are the the ways that

other countries have actually

been able to overcome them irena on its

part

does uh look at documenting these best

practices

and there are many other organizations

that also

do excellent documentation uh on these

so that uh apart from that i also think

what's important is

um is strengthened regional cooperation

because uh there is uh uh

you know the the disadvantages in in

one country can be offset if uh if you

look at a more uh regional kind of a

setting for

uh uh for implementation of uh

energy transition to come together and

also

uh uh i i think what's important is to

strengthen the risk mitigation

multilateral mechanisms for risk

mitigation because

that's uh that's very critical as

as we move to uh start walking the

the path that is is ambitious but

clearly doable

thank you very much so policymakers

aren't alone

and let's look at how other countries

have done it and that's what we'll be

doing

also later on today in the second day of

the betd

at this point i'd like to thank my

panelists um

ms singh mr atten and dr wilkinson and

of course

to fatih durmez and our apologies to

minister han

who wasn't able to join us today thank

you all so much for joining us

you
