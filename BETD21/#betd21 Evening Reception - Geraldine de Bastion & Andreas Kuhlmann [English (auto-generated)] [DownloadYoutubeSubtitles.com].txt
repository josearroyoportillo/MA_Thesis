welcome

to the seventh pregnant energy

transition dialogue

hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome

to our betd

evening event i am so excited to welcome

you to our show tonight

and i am also very excited to welcome my

co-host andreas kuhlman the ceo of the

german energy agency

here on stage with me hi andreas hi

geraldine hello

hello good evening and good morning good

afternoon to

all of you who are watching us from all

over the world today it's a virtual

conference so you can't be with us today

but we know that we have guests from

almost all continents

somebody just told me so we are very

happy to have you here this is

a very warm welcome from the heart of

the capital of germany it's a very warm

welcome

to the official evening reception of the

berlin energy transition

dialogue normally as most of you will

know we have like

800 or thousand people in front of us

celebrating

innovation and celebrating this

conference a huge get together

that's different today but we try to

make our best

out of it and well that's why we are

here

i'm your co-host today but the main host

is geraldine

debastion andreas you give me too much

credit thank you so much so

yes we are so sad that we couldn't bring

you all to berlin but we do hope that

we're gonna be able to bring a little

bit of berlin to you tonight so we're

broadcasting live

here from the telecom building in the

heart of berlin just around the corner

from our federal foreign office and we

have set up this little spati for you

here to transport a little bit of berlin

vibe or

corner shop if you're not so familiar

with the culture of spaties

so i'm very excited about the motto that

we have for tonight's show

which is multi-perspectivity 2050

joint challenges meet with innovative

solutions and we're going to be meeting

a lot of innovative

solutions tonight we're going to be

meeting individuals from all kinds of

different sectors

from arts culture research politics

and innovation and learning how they're

working to secure a climate neutral

future so really bringing in different

perspectives

for you and we have some exceptional

speakers that i'm really excited to

introduce

to all of you watching us tonight and we

also have some big announcements to make

right andreas yes it's true and also we

bring together people who never

met before and i think that is very

important of course as well

well tonight several high-level guests

of ours will announce the 15

finalists of this year's start up energy

transition

award the award 2021. we will talk a

little bit about

the set about later but we are very

excited to

present those 15 startups because we had

more than 500 applications again from

89 countries from all over the world and

everybody's

really excited now who will be one of

the finalists

but now at the beginning to kick off the

evening

we are very excited to show you a video

from the art

installation of artist christopher

bowder

who is with us tonight in a moment and

he is

i must say a magician a magician of

light and if you see

the little video we have for you you

will probably know

what i mean it is called dark matter his

new installation a parallel cosmos of

fantastic light installations in which

the boundaries between

the real and the digital worlds become

blurred here it is

[Music]

[Music]

so

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

really impressive images that we're

seeing there let me just introduce the

man behind that art too with a few more

sentences

christopher bauderer is the creative

director of a design studio called white

void which he founded after completing

his studies at the university of arts

here in berlin so he has this managerial

role at white void

but of course he's also an artist a

light and media artist who showcases his

art all across the world

and he's joining us tonight

welcome christopher can we see you

already i guess

the technique will hello oh we can hear

you that's that's perfect

because you are not around the corner

you're actually in riyadh in saudi

arabia is that true

yes i am okay you can tell us a bit

about this later on

but we are very happy to have you here

as our guest tonight

congratulations to your new project dark

matter we just saw it and thank you for

sharing us a little insight in this

project and it would be so

wonderful if you would be here with the

whole installation and we had

all these 800 people in front of us but

maybe next year

we will see when it comes to

multi-perspectivity you seem to be an

expert the connectivity and interplay of

hundreds of dimensions that you show us

with your fantastic light and sail

installations is something very very

special but but could you tell us a

little bit about the idea behind

this dark matter project yeah dark

matter is

a new light experience space

all together it's about 1 000 square

meters we have seven rooms

it's located in some old factory

buildings in berlin lichtenberg the

beautiful berlin lichtenberg

and the exhibition features seven of our

light installations that we produced

over the course of let's say last 20

years

the oldest one is the tone ladder it's

an interactive sound installation which

i built while i was

still studying in berlin in the art

university and the newest one is inverse

it's a kinetic installation that we

produced specifically for

dark matter this year and there's all

kinds of other

exhibitions big ones small ones uh some

are interactive

some are moving uh all of them are with

music of course

and with light and we will be able to

hopefully open it

at the beginning of may 7th of may is

our planned opening if politics allow us

hopefully at least via click and meet

i'm definitely looking forward to seeing

your

exhibition can you explain to us a

little bit what is it that you would

like visitors to experience

to feel what is the kind of journey you

want to take them on through the course

of your exhibition

yeah i mean maybe you can sum it up with

we develop

technology that moves and i mean that in

a double sense so

first of all we are trying to move

people through technology

so we're using a lot of motors and

lights and computers

and network and so on but this all

supposed to be in the background we are

trying to

evoke some emotions first we we cut you

off from your everyday environment we

call it dark matter for a good reason

you come inside it's pitch black

it's dark uh you're off of the

normal environment and then we're

charging you slowly with

small experiences with small triggers we

use light we use motion we use sound

we use a very abstract means to trigger

uh pictures that you have stored with

yourself like for example we have

one view that looks like the sun but

it's just lights it's just computer

controlled

but you have this picture of the sun

with you and so we're trying to

kind of take you on an emotional journey

christopher i want to try to draw a

little bit of a parallel for some of the

topics that we have here tonight so

later we're going to be speaking to

journalists scientists and activists and

of course they're trying to bring

attention to climate change and open

people's perspective up to what

that is doing to our planet so you know

sometimes in climate change it's hard to

see the big picture and you sort of feel

you get a glimpse of something

and um and trying to sort of open this

perspective how do you think art can be

a contribution

and help widen people's perspectives

like do you have any suggestions or

guidance

towards uh maybe also for our other

guests tonight

yeah i i think art and culture can be a

good platform to

to debate climate change even though

we're not maybe contributing

that much to it we're not that kind of

an industry

but i mean especially in the time of the

the global pandemic we realize that we

miss traveling we miss experience new

places we miss nature of course

and that makes us think about the way we

treat nature

and of course we miss culture and art

and

culture gives us joy in life and it's

free of any necessity you know it has no

real purpose

art is not essential to survive as we

have learned from our politicians now so

what i'm doing

no one really needs that but it is

essential

maybe even at the core of what it makes

what makes it worth for us to live and

and i believe that through art you can

send a powerful message and

always has been a powerful tool to get a

message to the people on a different

channel

maybe even make them rethink their lives

or their decisions

art is free of any practical application

but we are still longing to experience

it so it can give us an

idea of what's really important in life

like zoom out enjoy an art piece and you

kind of

get a sense of of what you're actually

longing for and i think artists and

scientists are

the four thinkers of the future they're

already imagining showing

what can be happening in the future what

solutions are out there how can we solve

these problems that we are facing now

while most of the people are still stuck

in the actual struggle of problems of

today

and so i think art provides inspiration

and also role models for a society

to follow christopher that was a great

plato year for really thinking out of

the box actually

and i know that your work really works

because i was part of this

big lishta grants like 20 years after

the fall of the wall

and there was an exciting tremendous

um project and i i'm very sure that your

new project here in berlin

soon coming up will be successful as

well thank you very much

for joining us for this little input but

for these very important thoughts and

all the best to read and welcome back

soon

thank you very much and hope you all can

join us at dark matter soon

bye-bye okay bye see you i really hope

so too so that's already been a little

exploration a little journey into the

world of

light art and our next guest is going to

take us

on a different kind of journey so again

we've

just experienced some visual

entertainment form and now it's time for

some acoustic entertainment form

i'm really excited to introduce to you

our musician that we have live with us

on stage here today

in the machine he's a multi-talented

person

who is known for his unique electronic

music performances

and the sort of special thing about the

music a machine produces

is that he makes his music using his

voice his body

and other and unexpected objects so

really also involving the environment

in his art in the machine it's fantastic

to have you here tonight

my pleasure good evening to everybody

good evening to you

thank you thanks for having me it's

really great to have you can you

take us a little bit inside your

personal journey how did you start

making music in this particular way uh

since i was a kid i always liked to

question everything

why things should be done in this way or

that way

and yeah i know i annoyed a lot my

parents with that

but that also led me to to to question

why music needs to always be done with

this traditional instrument so in a

certain way

and while i was in in the search for my

own

sound identity i discovered that

questioning the way

i made music would help me to find my

own path and identity and that's what i

made

that's lovely and i i think at least

this is my take

you know we that's how music started

people started making music with

their bodies or with things in their

environment before humans invented such

things as musical instruments so you're

kind of taking it way back to the roots

but with this innovative technological

twist i find that really exciting

exactly the idea is that to to exactly

not

stay on the on the traditional

or antique layer of the sounds of the

body of the voice and the object

i needed the technology so i could

process

these sounds and create new sounds from

these sources

so we're going to be hearing from you at

different points throughout the show

tonight but toward the

at the closing of the show to the grand

finale you have a special

thing prepared for us and i want to

explain that to our audience now

so as we said you use any kind of sound

bites to create your music

and tonight you're going to be using the

sound bites that people send to you

during the show via instagram to create

the final

closing piece so i want to demonstrate

to everybody how that's going to work

basically all you need to do is to go

to ain's instagram account which is

in the machine so it's very easy to find

on instagram and then when you're on the

instagram page

all you need to do is to click on

message so to send you a message

and then send you a little order

recording so we're going to try that now

you want me to say something i want you

to say something

all right so multi perspectivity is more

than

just a necessity boom and there we have

it so i hope you can put that to

good use and let's take it away for your

first performance please

okay let's go

[Music]

so

[Music]

so

check

[Music]

one two three

[Music]

so

[Music]

aim the machine number one we hear you

later again i saw where we are some

people here in that room

and not so many just a few of course but

i saw some buddies

moving that was a good start thank you

very much at the moment but now

i want to introduce some somebody else

to you and that is

a very special guest and i'm very very

proud to have her here it's

an medler can we see you

hello and it's so nice to to have you

with us because

i know that you love innovation and

we do love innovation as well at the

german energy agency

so we are very very happy to have you

with us tonight and

i want to introduce you a little bit

ametla

started her career working for the world

economic forum

leading the european department she

served the european commission as the

head of the internal strategy

department and as an entrepreneur at

heart she

passionately ran her own think tank for

over a decade

but that was not enough today she is the

vice president of

europe at breakthrough energy and works

hand

in hand with european partners to

accelerate

innovation in the pursuit of climate

neutrality and

a net zero emissions future we heard

many things about some of your projects

before here in germany at least and all

over europe i know

please welcome with me anne medler hello

thank you so much for having me

and it's it's great to have you here in

person tonight um and um breaks through

energy

well we all know this of course but it's

only since a while you are very active

in in brussels

as far as i know can you tell us a

little bit about

the work you do there and why you

decided to start this european office

over there absolutely with great

pleasure

yeah we have a little echo here but they

will solve it

okay okay so about a breakthrough energy

it was started

in 2015 at the time at the

cop 21 uh by bill gates uh

and uh some other business leaders

essentially

um they could see already then that work

needed to be done to avoid a climate

disaster

and uh you probably know that this is of

course also

actually the the uh the title of bill's

a new book uh how to avoid a climate

disaster

the solutions we have and the

breakthroughs we need so

bill is not coming at this you know

since yesterday i mean he's been

thinking about this i would say

now for well over two decades and

i think the starting point for bill and

breakthrough energy

is really i mean it's sort of the fact

that almost half of the emission cuts

that are needed to get us to net zero by


will have to come from technologies that

are not yet commercialized so that means

maybe they exist today but they are not

commercialized so they need

still a lot of development and as i'm

sure you know the international energy

agency

also keeps talking about this fact so

there is really an element here

around clean technologies that needs to

be addressed

and you already said it i um

i have been working on innovation for

most of my professional life

and let me say that the way we measure

progress in innovation at breakthrough

energy

is through the concept of what we call

the green premium so that is the cost

differential

between a clean solution and the

incumbent let's say

fossil fuel solution and really the goal

of our effort

is to dramatically decrease the green

premium in select technology areas and

help bring technologies

to scale in a nutshell the way you can

think about it

the bigger the green premium so the

bigger the price differential

the more innovation will be needed so to

reduce this grain premium

we are working across the entire

innovation cycle

from the earliest stage um let me just

maybe say we are building a program

um that sort of helps identify

researchers with really promising

groundbreaking ideas and we're helping

these researchers to take these ideas

out of the lab into an environment where

they can

test and validate their research

and bring it into a phase sort of an

early deployment

uh phase but that's of course not enough

that's just the beginning of

the innovation cycle so let me say

that we also have a very ambitious uh um

program at the demonstration phase

as sort of the scale-up phase of um of

uh the clean technologies i mean maybe

just to

to to to explain that if you look at a

typical innovation cycle

you're looking at over 25 years

at least and we believe that that

cycle takes too long we don't have 25

years

so we really need to think about how do

we accelerate

it and that's why we're saying yes we

need a supply of innovation but we also

need to demand for

innovation so here we have as i said we

have a program

that's working on this and it's

premature to speak that much about it

but this is in a nutshell

what breakfast well actually that's very

interesting i like very much that you

focused on this innovation cycle because

you know this is an audience here

where we have startups where we have

entrepreneurs where we have politicians

and i think to better understand what is

the innovation cycle and what other

hurdles is

very important to really scale up

innovation and that's what we need all

over

the world well i have the book on my

table actually there are so many books

but that is

right on the top already but let me ask

you what kind of innovation

what do you see i mean are there some

you would like to to to highlight

to mention but before you answer me i

see

when i look back over the last 10 years

you know like every couple of years

something new is popping up

and that is really a sign of hope in my

eyes but yeah what is the focus you have

on innovations at the moment

yeah let me first of all say this is of

course already the second cycle of

cleantech

innovation and we have sort of a first

one but that

didn't work out uh too well and we

believe that now

we're at the cusp of essentially sort of

a technology revolution the cleantech

revolution

but when we speak about innovation we do

it very broadly and we

have what we call five grand challenge

areas

they are electricity transportation

manufacturing

buildings and agriculture so it's of

course very important to understand that

we're not just talking energy here i

mean this really cuts across

pretty much everything we do so and

within these areas

we believe that we need to pursue

different options

to get to net zero we call this a

portfolio approach

of technology options and this portfolio

is what i want to emphasize because

let's be frank

many or at least some of these

technologies will fail

um of course some will succeed but some

of them will fail and i think we should

be very honest about it so it's

very important to spread the risk so

this is a way that we're working is

around the technology

portfolio approach also in our venture

fund it's called breakthrough energy

ventures

um there's a smaller european uh uh uh

component of that called uh breakthrough

energy ventures europe

and they are really following this

portfolio approach uh

as well so but let me maybe very briefly

and more specifically

i spoke about program we have on r d

there we are focused right now on zero

carbon hydrogen

electro fuels zero carbon cement

steel and fertilizers in this first

edition

on the later stage that a program that i

spoke about

in the scale-up phase we're focusing on

three

technologies it's green hydrogen

sustainable aviation fuels and direct

air capture

but next up is uh is a long duration

storage and then also green steel green

cement

okay well yeah i mean all the sectors

you you were mentioning

in all these sectors we see kind of an

exponential development of innovation

and sometimes

i think it's it's really interesting to

see how these

innovations in these different sectors

kind of interact

and there's even faster innovations

coming up

sometimes it might be hard to give this

innovation the right

direction because not every innovation

is good for the sake of the planet but

most of it and it's our task

to really help giving the right

direction here

i mean if you um did you talking a lot

to polit policy makers to to

startups to innovators where would you

see like the

the main hurdles or the main main

challenges i mean is there anything

you want to give us as an audience from

all over the world here

yeah so i mean i think that there are

two sort of

overriding challenges and i say it also

as someone originally

i come out of digital tech and cleantech

is actually quite different

firstly because it takes a long time

from lab to market

i already spoke that about this uh

earlier

and it's just too long if we really

serious about net zero by mid-century

we cannot allow these technologies 25 or

30 years to mature

so that's why we're really working on

accelerating the innovation cycle so

first problem time from lab to market

secondly it's what i spoke about

already it's the green premium so this

has to be reduced if we are really

hoping that these technologies will get

pick up what makes this very challenging

is that

if you think about the products

themselves they're not really

differentiated

so clean or green cement

steel clean fuels they are not

really different from their fossil fuel

competitors

they're just significantly more

expensive sometimes three to four times

as much

so what do we do about this you know if

we wait for normal market dynamics to

play itself out we will wait a long time

and this is why we believe

we can do something to sort of organize

a little bit the demand

side of this huh so we're working for

instance on

a um on a buyer's club for grain steel

we're thinking about buying down

the cost differential there are many

things we can do but if i have one

message today

don't just think about the supply think

about how you organize the demand yeah

very good you can if i follow you i see

you could talk about innovation

like like for ages but that's very good

actually

and well i can assure you that the

german government also is very much

focusing on innovation i think that is

something what we learned over the last

two or three years that we really have

to push for innovation and also

that innovation is available and we just

have to get

a better eyes and but also have to take

care of the right and proper

regulations so that is why i mean all

these topics you were mentioning are

also part of this berlin energy

transition

dialogue conference but not only this i

mean we had

us online speaking here we had john

kerry speaking here everybody was very

excited

and well i mean what is your

view on this transatlantic alliance

of the options we we might have again

after we had a pretty dark perspective

for the last four years

absolutely so let me first of all say

we are very excited obviously about

what's happening in the us

right now we're delighted that the

united states is back in the paris

agreement

um and and also let's say really um

in the back in the cleantech race i mean

that's uh that's one thing

to to really consider here um

i have to say that uh i think

breakthrough energy is really uniquely

positioned to facilitate between both

sides of the atlantic and

what i personally will say and here i

speak a little bit more with sort of

coming from the perspective

of public policy we need leadership

right now

we need courage and we need investments

in these new technologies

and in my opinion europe and the united

states i am

pole position to to get serious about

really scaling these technologies making

doing more than just announcements

really

making it happen through projects in the

ground

and to to take that first step because

we need sort of we need geographies to

come together right now to show

we're working together on this we're

doing something you know beyond just

making more announcements

and here i have high hope that for

instance through the european commission

spoke about the green tech alliance i

don't know exactly what form it will

take

but my feeling is that the opportunity

is huge and that we need something like

this

not only in advance of the earth day

summit that

uh that uh john kerry is organizing in

april

but particularly in advance of the cop

and in the run-up of the cop

26 in november where we really need to

get serious about a lot of what we're

discussing here this evening

yeah okay the transatlantic alliance is

a good start but it needs to be

bigger of course at the end but we have

so many

countries going for climate neutrality

uh in

in this year and so we can be very

positive about the outcome maybe so but

we all have to

to push it well thank you maybe just a

quick word some quick words about the

very next steps you have on your agenda

yeah so i mean i always say we need to

connect the dots the fact is

a lot is happening but we now really

need to bring the right

actors together let me say that i am

maybe tonight is a good opportunity to

announce actually that we'll be working

with dana

on a to create a tech for net zero

alliance uh

and this alliance will convene leading

innovators

from germany including research

institutes venture funds startups

corporations

and and i think uh hopefully we can work

together to raise the voice of

these innovators in the in the policy

domain it's particularly important this

year

with the elections coming up um i know

we'll also

have the the net uh the tech for net

zero alliance will be supported by

a content partner one point 1.5 degrees

ventures

which is a berlin-based climate

adventure builder

so we're very much looking forward to

working with dana we look forward to

working with you andreas

and if i have one message it's really

let's make

it happen if not now then when germany

is in my opinion in pole position

it plays to germany's strength it's

about deep tech

it's about entrepreneurship it's about

engineering

and that's why i'm looking to germany

for leadership in this uh

very critical and important year i mean

if i wouldn't be the co-model writer of

this event i would

you know probably create a breakout

session and go with you in that breakout

session and have another talk later on

but the secretary of state andreas fight

is already in the room he was listening

and i think he will probably join our

alliance later on thank you very much

for being with us and a very inspiring

speech

really fitting perfectly to this evening

thank you very much and all the best

bye-bye thank you well i totally

understand that you would want to carry

on that discussion

but thanks for not leaving me here

andreas but congratulations to that new

partnership

we have now reached that point of the

evening where we're going to actually

begin

announcing those 15 finalists for the

set awards

2021 but before we begin i just want to

give a little bit of background about

the set program maybe for those viewers

who aren't so familiar with it yet

so the startup energy and transition is

a global platform that really supports

energy transition and innovation in

energy transition

its aim is to really deepen productive

connections between the different

stakeholders so

between established corporate players

the public sector

and the world of energy innovation it

connects these stakeholders via the

platform

in order to rapidly scale the adoption

of clean energy

technology so that's the aim of the

platform and the program itself

and of course the startup energy and

transition award is the international

competition for startups

and young companies worldwide that are

really shaking up the global energy

sector and forming our way into energy

transition

and and trying to stop um the climate

from changing in a negative way so

it's the kind of creme de la creme of

the startups of the world that come

together there

and that we're going to feature as you

said we had

543 applications from all across the

world

this year from 89 countries so i'm just

recapping those numbers that andrea's

mentioned earlier because i find them so

impressive and the set list of 100 so

the 100

top startups from that list of

applicants

that was published last week and you can

check out their pitches throughout the

betd

week and i really encourage you to do so

because apart from the 50 finalists

there's some other great companies

in that batch yeah and now we're going

to begin with the announcement of the

finalists in the first

category and that is clean energy

generation

and a very special law data for this is

the already mentioned secretary of state

andreas

feist who is also kind of the host of

this whole conference together with

the ministers of course so thank you for

just coming over it's just a cornerstone

away this

is the conference room well what is your

impression of the first day of this

conference

well quite uh quite satisfied it's a

success it's not easy to

organize organize such a big conference

purely virtual but we are quite happy

and

a little bit proud that this betd

has become a leading international

conference when it comes to energy

transition so

we're quite happy so i think it's very

important to even do that in corona

times or especially do it maybe

in corona times feedback is good so far

as you you mentioned

fitbig is great and uh from not only

from the participants but also

from the panelists and all the speakers

you mentioned it we had ozil from the

lion here they called the president of

the

european commission we had john kerry

here of ministers about 40 or 50

ministers said secretaries from all over

the world so

quite quite a success i would say okay

well anne midler spoke about leadership

and i must say because you are really a

supporter of our startup energy

transition

project not only in spirit but also in

money because such a project needs money

that is already

enough leadership for the moment but you

even have more leadership because you

would introduce a

finalist of the first category so thank

you again and

the floor is yours thank you well i want

to honor

to kick off this betd evening reception

highlight announcing the set 2021

finalists in the first category

clean energy generation clean energy

generation solutions have already come a

long way

there has been an incredible progress in

generating clean energy

over the last decades however there are

still so many

more opportunities in this field that

was always shaped

by innovation this category calls for

small technologies

and solutions to innovate the way we

generate

energy the jury members have carefully

evaluated

this year's applications and selected

three startups

to become set 2021 finalists

it is my honor to now announce the three

funnels in the category

clean energy generation

finalist number one is a colego from

germany

a collego enables businesses in emerging

markets to use clean

energy with a fully financed solar as a

service solution

ecoligo makes it easy for businesses to

go green and lower

the energy costs

finalist two is wingy from switzerland

windy's artificial intelligence based

software platform analysis

reports forecasts and calculates

recommendations

to improve production and overall

performance of individual

renewable assets and entire portfolios

and finally finalist number three is

power up from estonia

powerup produces hydrogen fuel cell

based electric

generators and proton exchange membrane

fuel cells the generators have diverse

use cases

in industries such as marine

telecommunication

military construction hospitals

off-grid homes and rescue forces

to name a few congratulations to these

three finalists and good luck for the

coming journey

thank you very much thank you

so much thanks so much for being here

and congratulations of course from our

side to the finalists as well

thank you congratulations

me

[Music]

[Music]

yes

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

uh

[Music]

thank you yes thank you

very much so ladies and gentlemen i'm

extremely excited to welcome our next

guest

live on stage here with us dr anthia

bouitious is director of the

alfred wegner institute helmholtz center

for

polar and marine research she heads a

joint

research group for deep sea ecology and

technology at the max planck institute

for marine microbiology and she has

received multiple awards like the german

environmental award

and is also chair of the steering

committee science and dialogue

welcome professor dr anta burtios it's

fantastic to have you here with us

tonight

you have been as a polar deep sea

researcher on over 50 expeditions

as i understand in international vested

vessels but tonight you're here with us

in berlin and exploring our little

spirit stage

with us thanks for being here

before we begin with our conversation we

want to get some visual impressions of

the kind of work we do

you do and you've brought a little video

that we can see here today

it's a um the title of the film that

we're going to see is mosaic

and i would say let's start the film and

and see what you're up to when you're

not here on stage with us in front of

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

so

[Music]

ancient thank you very very much for

sharing this

little movie with us i mean it's a

little movie but it's

a beautiful movie strong pictures and

strong

messages as well and um well

i know that you have not been on board

of polanche and

you've been on so many trips but i know

that these

600 people and 20 nations and so i think

they were very very happy

that you were not on board that you were

in brim and it took care of all the

problems

you had to go through when you were

organizing this this

mission can you really describe it a bit

yeah it was very special because it was

a year

visit to the region around the north

pole the central arctic which is

the warmest the the most warming region

of earth due to climate change it is

really amazing and so the pictures that

we have now the understanding for a year

full year round observation shows us

that

uh what we do as humans is connected to

the rest of the planet and everywhere

even the most remote places so

normally people don't think of the north

pole as being connected to them but

i think these images show that that it's

all one planet and we just have this one

planet and our mission was about

uncovering some of the enigmatic

energy fluxes that we have in the north

that explain why it's warming so fast

i think that this this explanation was

was a huge success i mean i think that

the whole world was was following

everything

but i just wonder whether everybody

knows what mosaic stands for

i will i will tell you it says

multidisciplinary drifting

observatory for the study of arctic

climate that's what it is

exactly right i mean it was a technical

spectacular

journey as well wasn't it right right

because our ship polarstan

which is now around 40 years old went

with this crew of scientists and

technicians and polar bear watchers and

everyone for a year into the arctic so

we had planned to exchange them every

two to three months but then came

the corona pandemic but basically this

challenge to go to a place where we have

so little data but which is so central

to our climate that was really the point

of this mission so can you share some of

those key findings with us and maybe

also what you're doing with that data

now after the mission

yeah so the state of the arctic sea ice

has become one of the key indicators for

the state of our planet

um since i was a phd student working up

there

it has been much reduced in dimension

both in

in extension as well as as volume

and thickness and we know that it's

directly correlated to the co2 emissions

that we humans have put into the

atmosphere

with mosaic we wanted to understand the

full

systemic interaction between the

atmosphere the eyes and the oceans and

all life in it

and this was really the purpose of

working together with 20 nations having

so

many hundreds of scientists on board and

finding out how we can better predict

our future by better understanding

processes in the arctic that have been

hidden just because people don't go

there in winter time it's not accessible

it's an ocean with ice on top

has no meteorology stations so all the

data we have is from 125 years ago but

bridge of nunsen was there

in winter time around the north fore

region and then it was

quite some colder at that time yes it

was um we have figured out that

it was 10 degrees colder in on average

at the winter time when friedrich nunsen

was there compared today so when we are

talking global

shifts global change keeping the planet

warming below two degrees

we have already measurements that show

that in the arctic regions we are far

beyond

we also have data that show how dynamic

the sea ice is so it goes away it melts

rapidly in summertime it freezes back in

winter time

but not to the original thickness and

extent so already during our time so we

are eyewitnesses of this dramatic change

and the arctic that was there when i was

a phd student is no longer there i was

just going to say auntie you've been

experiencing this within your own

lifetime

how how how does that feel i wanted to

ask but like what has that process been

like for you to come there as a phd

student

and to revisit and to see all this with

your own eyes yeah it is basically

having the data at hand

that show how much parts of our planets

are changing

and to to say that even for the remote

environments where we think this is

nature this is the nature we have

preserved because so few people

live up there in the central arctic so

few people are around antarctica

but then to be eyewitnesses to know that

our generation is the one

which sees this type of arctic for the

last time maybe the first generation

that sees how the summertime

sea ice goes away melts out all of these

knowledges just need

we have to take our role as eyewitnesses

very importantly we need to preserve the

information how a system of planet earth

works when it's not so warm when it's

not

warmed by us humans we also have to find

solutions and knowledge is part of the

solution finding for sure because we can

make better predictions about climate

weather extremes that we are facing

by having that knowledge well i mean the

arctis is a huge

archive also for data and because you

can measure data from

hundreds of years ago and and all these

things

but i think that was not the core of the

work you did

this time i mean if you said 600

scientists

well what what kind of sciences i mean

what what kind of um

yeah areas did they work on i mean so

many it was really a little bit of an

aquinoa of natural sciences

so we had we had of course the

atmospheric scientists their role was to

find out how rapid warming and cooling

works in the atmosphere

today we speak sometimes of 40 degrees

changes within a few days we recently

had that in germany as well

but in the arctic it has become really

common in winter time it can be plus

degrees

imagine that in summertime they were

present when it was

above 30 degrees in siberia which is

normally a frozen region

so these shifts immense shifts how can

energy be transported so fast in the

atmosphere with stair drop and then we

had sea ice uh

physicists sea ice biologists we had

real biologists

who were looking at the animals that we

still have out there

we don't even know how exactly in the

arctic winter time

species survive when for six months

there is no sunlight hence there is no

plant production then we had

oceanographers who had to figure out

what the role of the warming ocean is

for melting sea ice

or for changing the atmosphere changing

precipitation so there was really

something to do for everyone

so there will be a huge series of papers

coming up

past the upcoming years i mean are there

any plans to do something similar

again like in a couple of years normal

yeah well it was such an expensive and

large mission it took

since 2011 to prepare for it and

now we have data i think for many years

to come

because for the first time all of the

data we have achieved are synchronous

they are have been worked on and

parallel so we can really figure out how

some storms change the life under the

eyes or how

some of the life under the eyes emits

chemicals that we find in the atmosphere

so this connectivity of

everything it's the first time that can

we can do it because we're at all the

modern sensors along with us

i would be curious to find out a little

bit more about the international

collaboration you said over 20 nations

sounds like a space mission you know

like a huge thing

um can you just maybe like fill us in a

little bit about the background how that

came together and also how it worked out

in practice

yeah so the atmospheric scientists

started off that project they had

discussed it for a long time we need all

to come together to figure out processes

that no one understands

and they are an international crowd they

have met at several conferences

we have received the proposal can polash

then our german research vessels serve

the world to do this mission and we were

happy when we found the funds to support

it

with the help of our ministry for

research and education we were able to

pull it through with the help of the

helmholtz association but the moment

when the ship left off with those people

also young students and senior polar

researchers and i saw all of them

they came from russia from china from

all continents basically

um whole from europe everyone was there

walking onto the ship and leaving for

that mission and it felt

as it should be that this one planet is

looked after by unity of humans that's

what it

felt to me and that's how i loved this

mission very much because it stayed that

way even during

the pandemic it's beautiful we will talk

about um

science politics communication later on

a little bit

but i mean just just one little thing

here i think you did a

very good job in communicating this

journey as well was

that part of your plan or was it by

accident because

the topic was just you know on the

agenda

no we knew that because it was such a

big mission we wanted to bring the north

pole into the

bunsen into the homes of everyone

worldwide

and so we had to team up with the best

of the media people

photographers we got a great

photographer she stays with us esther

robert

we had great camera people the ufa

supported this mission by producing

movies we saw these little clips

so it was a year-round company camera

teams with us

and it was so important and it really

worked hand in hand because

again just think for a moment everyone

who is listening now

these may be the pictures that last when

the world is no longer

that way so our children and

grandchildren will have those

movies will have those photographies of

a planet like it could be

should be and is maybe not and that's

important

maybe before we go into the next

category because we have to introduce

our finalists and just

find a question for this first section

with you

any new hopes or rather frustration

well there is always hope and

frustration i mean

today was published germany has just

made it with its climate goals for

2020 due to the pandemic we saved eight

percent energy

or co2 emissions and we just right on

the spot

uh with our reduction in energy and co2

emission

but we know that the pandemic will

thankfully not last that long and that's

not the way to plan

energy transformation it is not so there

is hope that

we all together can shape a better

future but there's also frustration that

it takes so long and has already caused

so much damage in the nature

and with people okay that's a question

about politics about

us yes but it's also a bit a question of

innovation

and that's why we now go back to

category two

category two and uh it's up to me to

introduce it is andreas our special

partner of this

wonderful project it's dr angela

wilkinson she is secretary general

and ceo of the world energy council well

that's

just what she is but she is much more

she is a true friend of our project

she's a partner

of our project and the whole world

energy council is partnering with the

german energy agency

for a couple of years now on this

wonderful set award project

it's really a pleasure to work together

with her

and her team and that's why i'm very

very happy that she was

joining us from london and just now

giving

the finalists for this second

category and well i think

the floor is yours angela

good evening to all of you and in

particular to all the startups

which have been selected to be part of

the set 100

for 2021 my name is angela wilkinson

and i'm the secretary general and ceo of

the world energy council

we started out nearly 100 years ago as

the world's

first permanent energy organization

as a community of common sense we

safeguarded an agenda

of energy for peace a century later

we are working across nearly a hundred

countries to enable energy

for people and planet and to secure more

energy

and climate neutrality our worldwide

community comprises the full spectrum

of the increasing diversity in energy

systems worldwide

all sectors and all parts of the value

chain

and wider stakeholders system designers

builders operators regulators

investors and inventors

our humanizing energy agenda reflects

the role of people in energy

and a bigger and exciting story of

energy

the future of more energy and climate

neutrality

in which energy is not just another

commodity

or all about carbon but the enabler of

human progress

we welcome the new spirit of

entrepreneurship in energy

and also value the role of entrepreneurs

energy matters today to everyone and

everything

and we the world energy community share

the purpose and passion

which drives entrepreneurs it's an honor

for me to join you today

to present the finalists of the startup

energy transition award

for 2021 i'd like to thank andreas

coleman

ceo of the german energy agency dana

together we have created a global

platform for energy innovation

ecosystems

bringing together startups energy firms

policymakers

investors scholars and students to work

together towards an inclusive

and climate neutral energy future

humanizing energy agenda highlights that

the ways in which energy is being used

stored and produced are shifting in fast

and

fundamentally new ways demand-driven

solutions and

customer-centric systems are not just

buzzwords they are new directions

this is why we created a new category

this year

on energy demand to highlight startup

energy entrepreneurs

around the world who are working on

demand side innovation

the selection process has been tough

despite the global pandemic

we've received an incredible number of

high quality

applications the improvements get better

every year

our first finalist for this category and

this is where it starts to feel a little

bit like the oscars

is alum energy from australia their

product is called soul share

and it works behind the meter to share

the power generated

from a single solar system to multiple

apartments

our second finalist is standard euler

incorporated

from the united states their smart air

delivery platform

ensures that heating and cooling is

delivered to rooms

with people in them this ensures energy

efficient consumption

eliminates eliminates balance problems

and helps occupants to stay

comfortable in the process our third

finalist in this category

is the kona solutions a b from sweden

econo is a software company that does

edge machine

learning which has clever stuff enabling

smart

self-learning and predictive features

for machines

vehicles and other connected devices the

internet

of things congratulations to alum

energy standard euler inc and econo

solutions for making the finals

i wish each of you the best of luck and

whatever happens

we can join voice forces and humanize

energy together thank you

dr angela wilkinson and and

congratulations to the finalists from

our side

[Music]

so



[Music]

so

so

[Music]

wait

is

[Music]

[Music]

ladies and gentlemen

our next guest is a bit of a legend and

he's also helped turn

other people into legends jim rakita

is a berlin based and born photographer

photolist journalist

filmmaker author and producer he has

worked with world famous artists

politicians he brought the neue deutsch

fellow musicians

to a different stage of fame but that's

not what we're here to talk about

tonight tonight we want to explore

jim's engagement to support the climate

movement

and his new work in that field um jim

like i said you've traveled the world

and lived in different places so we're

so excited that you're actually able to

be with us in person here physically in

berlin today

and since you're in berlin uh jim we met

a couple of times we know each other for

for quite a while

and we of course we spoke about art and

films and photographs

but actually we basically spoke about

politics

so that's why i can say you are very

interested in politics

very interested in things which matter

to the sake of the planet and

that's why i'm very happy to have you

here yeah thanks for having me

so as i said tonight we're going to

focus on the work you've been

doing recently in regards to

highlighting the climate crisis and

climate activists

and you also brought a little bit of a

trailer or a clip of a film

your new film now for us to see tonight

so we're going to start by looking at

that

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

together and united we are

unstoppable how dare you continue to

look away

we need some global warming it's

freezing if you choose

[Music]

and

[Music]

[Music]

and to protect our people

[Music]

we're fighting the most powerful lobbies

in the world and the most powerful

political

institutions we won't get anywhere

in chaos the big moves they need to be

thought through

there's a david against goliath thing

here we need to think of resources that

are

unique and this is for us it's young

voices it's young minds it's

young people who have a right to have a

to have a future

no one can take us away from them it's

the strongest argument

i get goosebumps um seeing those

pictures of pre-protest

a pre-pandemic protest sorry um

and i'd like to start by asking you what

was the point in your life where you

decided this is going to be the next

topic you want to work on

actually the book was offered to me by

the author

um claudia rincke who had worked for the

un for a while

and then written this kind of script uh

for this documentary and i got really

interested but

at the time we didn't know how big the

movement would be

so uh we put her little dog

in in a bag and i took my camera and we

went

and we took a look at the first

rallies that there that they were out

there for

fridays for future and uh it came to a

tipping point where you could

really sense that this was going

someplace

and uh it was pretty clear that we uh

wanted to do a film and give a voice to

these young people

and follow their path from uh from a

grassroot

protest to the u.n climate uh

summit so you were there just as at the

cusp of time

basically to follow that process and

accompany the movement so to speak

uh i got pulled into this i could say

because

you know when you when you start

something like that and uh

there's there's a certain point where

you cannot

return where you cannot you know

yeah walk away from it yeah you cannot

walk away from it you have to do it

and luckily enough we found a producer

uh

who was interested in doing that and

then uh

in a court time of 14 days or

three weeks i think we shot the whole

rest of the film

with a very small crew it sounds like

you got um

infected in a positive sense would you

say and this is the topic we'd like to

delve on a bit later in more detail as

well

that your role is as a journalist as an

observer

or that you see yourself as part of the

movement of supporting the movement

through the work that you do

no it's not like that i belong to a

generation

who caused this so i can't wash that off

my hands

um that was one one side of it

that i thought i owe this some

inspection this whole thing

and the other thing was that i really

wanted to give a voice to these people

because they come from all different

walks of life you have like um the

activists come from different fields

with different experiences they have

one little thing in common and that is

um

i'd say a cause of climate justice

and there are many um under sections of

climate justice as such because you have

the generational conflict of leaving a

world in such a bad state

to young people who have to live with

what we left

and we don't have to face these

consequences anymore but they will

that's one part of the problem the

generational part

and then there's the climate justice as

it happens everywhere in the

in in the world like we um

our wrongdoings are are causing effects

in countries that we don't even

know yeah and like the maladies are

whatever it's a critical state right now

and we have to combine forces to uh

to get this fixed and the the young

people

you know whatever they say

is being judged from like uh

from higher ground all the time yeah

they're young people

they have a right to do so but you know

this

is a new kind of discussion ever since

friday's for future took the lead it's a

new discussion because they have a

different culture of saying what they

want

it's a more scientifical approach than

than

all the things before were you know it's

no longer it's no longer just

complaining

maybe one more question on that you've

seen different social movements in your

time i just i want to kind of dig a bit

deeper on what you just said do you feel

this is actually qualitatively new the

way that this generation

is approaching their social activism and

their environmental activism

with the scientific approach with the

research approach

and with the different alliances they're

building and

not only the alliances but also the fact

that

um most of the spokespeople from the

movements are women

and that sets a different uh sets a

different

sound yeah you know to everything so you

look at it in a different way

all of a sudden so i think this is i

mean today tonight's topic is multi

perspectivity and

uh i had a chance to watch the whole

movie unfortunately it's not yet out

because of corona

yeah it's frozen it's frozen

it's probably coming soon we talk about

this later on

i mean you had many perspectives

in the movie but i mean one target is

that what

one could say a multi-perspectivity from

all over the world

but a clear common target

actually we had the you know we had this

route

that the activists were going you know

from from a grassroots movement

to the u.n that was like the uh

the frame for the whole thing the

narrative

um but uh apart from that

i get pretty infected by the idea of

of climate justice uh just just the

thought of that you know when you when

you dig deeper into that thought

i mean how dare we live like we do

how dare we talk about it and not do

enough you know

this is it's amazing and we had that

highlight you know in new york we

we came to new york and this happened

right in front of our camera

that trump stood up and left the room

and uh and uh and greta uh

had her speech which uh which was

delivered in quite an effective way i

have to say

i mean we have both of you here

on stage and uh i mean there's this

science

aspect of the last two or three years

which really

has become a strong focus and then this

strong movement and i mean if you you

see these um pictures from from the

movie you think um until that it really

went

hand in hand over the time and was it is

it a strong alliance

also if you feel between these young

people and the work you do

yeah i mean i i mostly felt not so i

mean i felt that alliance not so much as

a scientist but because when i was a kid

we went to the streets and protested

against the atomic war

and chemical warfare and that was also

on scientific ground

because it just makes no sense and it is

also an aspect of justice who is doing

what to whom and what does it cost

and you have lived to protest where it

was against fascism and universities and

other things so

i think the street protest of a young

generation that wants a different future

as something that belongs to us and that

is a very healthy thing because it

gets us to where we want to a future we

want and so we should not

abolish it and say that's just young

people because

we have been in that age and we've also

had reasons to worry about our future so

so that goes hand in hand

but i mean there is a pretty strong

focus on the science issue though

i mean it is it always was also in

former times but i think this time

it's i see all these not only young

people but very much

interested in really understanding what

is what is the reason what are the

technologies available

and they even do studies and things like

that of course because it's not only

about human life

so this time it's about all life on the

planet

so the changes that are already there

just look at our forests

isconnect is connected to all life on

earth and that has a different angle a

different perspective

yeah we look forward to continuing

discussion with both of you

in a few minutes but we're going to

insert the announcements

for the finalists in the third category

in the meanwhile and the third category

is energy distribution

and storage so we're very proud to

welcome

energy token for the speech and

announcement of these finalists here

with us on stage today henry token is a

specialist for international

digitization

policy and international climate and

environment policy

new token has represented germany in

several countries including incontinence

in africa

and north america as an ambassador and

he's also represented

excuse me germany as a different

multilateral organization so including

the fao

the wfp and ifad in italy

today he is the director for

international climate

and energy policy and digital

transformation

here at the federal foreign office it's

great to have you here today with us

henry

thank you yeah thank you dr henry turken

thank you henry for for being with us

uh you're very experienced what we could

just hear from

geraldine but i need to ask you first of

course i mean what

is your impression of the conference so

far are you satisfied with

the way it approaches i love it it's

great i mean it's the first time we do

it in a full hybrid or virtual way

but i'm amazed how well it functions and

how how

much energy is is flowing across the

virtual channels i would never

have expected this well i mean you are

working a lot on

transformations in different countries

in the different aspects i mean

so anyone anything you you see

everybody has in common which you would

like to highlight or is a

just a different variety of

transformations we see all over the

world

i think we need a lot of transformation

and transformation in various sectors

one

refers to coal coal has been the

original driver of our industrialization

some hundred years ago 200 years ago but

now we should put

coal to rest we should get out of coal

because it is the most polluting

fossil fuel that we have i think the

second transformation we need is to

really ratchet our ambition on our way

towards the next climate conference in

the cop 26 in glasgow in november this

year

we should use all the opportunities and

all the dialogues that we have to make

the country's targets more ambitious

even more ambitious and the third

transformation i think is the most

crucial one

it's perhaps a transformation from the

old fossil mindset

to a new sustainable renewable mindset

and this is needed to really take the

right policy decisions so

a multifaceted transformation if you so

will all right and i mean it's

time having you here it's no longer an

issue only for the environment minister

or for the minister of energy

it's also a topic for the foreign

ministry all over the world

i must say isn't it definitely i mean

energy and climate have become

key questions of foreign policy and this

is not only about let's say sexual

policies looking at power production or

like heating or cooling it's also about

let's say the global international order

it's about

the international ranking of nations

it's also a question of power in the end

all right and it's also a question of

technologies and that's why you're here

today

because you will introduce the next

three finalists

in our category on energy distribution

and storage solutions

thank you for being with us thank you

okay it is with great pleasure that i am

now announcing this year's finalists in

the category

energy distribution and storage we have

seen a dramatic drop in prices

for storage solutions in recent years

yet this is only just the beginning

and there's still a lot of room for

improvements not just around costs

but also with materials that we are

using for storage solutions

so the first finalist is a cure battery

intelligence

from germany a cure makes batteries safe

reliable and sustainable using cloud

computing

building on a highly scalable web

platform battery manufacturers and

operators can manage

and optimize their battery systems

without the need for additional hardware

the second finalist is avergen from

australia evergin builds software

optimizing energy storage systems

and orchestrating large fleets of

batteries to enable

virtual power plants in the first the

third finalist is the most difficult to

pronounce i suppose it's

on ompassimo from belgium ompassimo

develops innovative dynamic line rating

systems

for transmission and distribution system

operators

made of standalone sensors that are

coupled to software interfacing

with dispatching centers congratulations

to all the finalists and good luck for

everything that's lying ahead of you

thank you thank you dr turken thank you

very much thank you so much

talking and congratulations to the

finalists from us

there are two things that

don't have to mean anything one is music

and the other is life

it don't have to mean anything that is

[Music]

thank you so much aim um i want to get

back to what you were saying earlier jim

because it really resonated with me

about

this movement having something that's

qualitatively new

and um you met greta and you met louisa

when doing this documentary so i

hope you can very verify my assumption i

feel like

first of all these are already tech

savvy and media savvy young people who

know what they're doing and what message

they're

putting out in the world really well

informed and really alert and aware and

i'm also

personally very excited to see so much

female leadership and this

idea of intersectionality between

feminism and climate change as well

um yeah so i would maybe you can share a

little bit

of your experience of meeting some of

these thought leaders

and um and whether this is the case that

this is really

their chance to unite social movements

maybe different than other social

movements of the past that fall apart

over differences because they have this

one

big cause that is so clear to all of

them yeah there was one

thing that interested me uh how did this

movement stop

so many times i mean you mentioned it

too there were

like so many uh warning signs and

writings on the wall

uh there was the oil crisis in the mid

70s then there

we had the club of rome report we had

all kinds of moments

where we could have stopped and think

about it and

for some reason it got blown over and i

think the

past two decades we were

kind of sleepy about it because we got

so much new technology

yeah and you know that's when you're

when you're a techie you you like all

that stuff you like all this stuff

you like the blue rail technology you

like all that

digital promise and you want to have it

that way

but at the same time we used more and

more

and more and more energy and we emitted

uh even more

uh co2 all the time

and uh and we got a little bit weary

about that

we we didn't pay attention and it was

about time when the big fire started and

when

when the temperature rose it was about

time to do something about it

and here comes a whole new generation of

protesters

who don't stop uh you know at the idea

of boots on the ground

but who also have this great ability to

uh to network with each other um

so that was important you know these

these these people from all different uh

movements um on different topics

and some scientists um who uh

you know who who built an alliance with

them and and

uh who made clear what this is all about

like this

race between ecology and economy right

now

that's what we're seeing i mean it's

like a showdown right yeah but

maybe if i may ask you because i mean

we had former social movement on

on environmental issues as well i mean

we had this huge earth

summit 1992 and 30 years ago

almost and then we had paris we had

kyoto we had the paris agreement

and and so many other things we had the

pope writing this um

this um laudato sea and other religions

were active as well

is it maybe the case that this

new movement just came on the right time

so everybody has

kind of had kind of a feeling that what

i mean

we are doing wrong we are doing wrong

but somebody really has to tell us again

is it something like this or how would

you describe it

well so we have a lot of young

scientists who are also part of the

movement and when we discuss together

they say

for them it is not solved yet so they

are loud and clear

but they measure themselves their impact

they measure it by the co2 in the

atmosphere and so far there has not been

a turn

of co2 we are seeing now an effect on

co2 emissions but

mostly by the pandemic it has globally

declined co2 emissions by seven to eight

percent

just because uh mobility broke down to

by seventy percent

and consume broke down a little bit and

all we all clear about this the future

the solution has to come together still

it's not organized yet

so there's this fear of backlash of

course after covet as well

and also the issue that of course in the

midst of this pandemic with all our

short attention spans and the media

overload

this topic is not in the top of the

everybody's

agenda um how are you trying to stop

that i know

maybe also with your work of scientists

for future that you're targeting policy

makers

and also maybe the course of this film

and your hopes of who

it's going to reach maybe you can both

share a little bit

how you hope that we can try to maintain

this dynamic and momentum

and not let the pandemic and the maybe

backlash after the

hopefully end of the pandemic um

get in the way of of of climate and

climate improvement let's say

actually i have two hopes first of all i

see a different

kind of behavior towards climate uh

amongst young people

if you look at the shell studies you

know there was always for

for decades there were cars in uh you

know on the wish list

of uh of every young person

gone yeah gone um

then there was uh uh you know there was

like everybody traveling was

so big and right now when you look at it

this has

changed in a big way it hasn't changed

in the older generation as much as i

would hope for

um what i do see though is is one thing

that gives me courage to

follow this uh all along and that is

that

the um the growth of world population

is slowing down much earlier than any

scientist

expected that's like the time joker that

we have

it's not getting as fast as we thought

it would it was like predicted that this

would

explode during these during this decade

if i'm not totally mistaken uh up to

2050 and it slowed down miraculously

so we have a little bit of a chance it's

i mean it's against all odds but still

we have a chance

and if we if we do the right legislative

work

if we do the right if we find the right

behavior

towards co2 we can do a lot

and innovation is a big part of it i

think the scientific

point is that we can now really well

calculate how much co2 we can still emit

before we reach the 2 degree above 2

degree

warming compared to the 1950s which

makes a big difference to all of us

especially also germany many many

countries because of drought because of

extreme weather because of flooding

and all of the other results if you take

that amount and if we're divided by the

annual emission of co2 we can see that

we have maybe 10 years before

we reach an amount of co2 in the

atmosphere that causes two degrees

warming because earth is also responding

to warming we know it from earth's

history when it gets warmer

the soil the forest everything emits

more co2

and so that scientific knowledge helps

us at least to say exactly where do we

have to change where are the biggest

step in transition so that's an

important

agreement that we have with the youth

and scientists if we just have that

little time we have to look for the big

screws we have to turn the big wheels

not the tiny little small ones

and in there it has been mentioned this

evening emit

we don't have to use coal anymore we

don't

we have to use much more red generative

energies we are able to use them

but foremost and i agree exactly what

was that in the beginning

we have to create a political framework

in which

working climate neutral is awarded is

incentivized and not punished

we are working in a world all of us

where

to be sloppy with the environment to be

bad with co2 emissions is actually the

cheapest

most likely most comfortable way you can

live your life good politics is to

change that to give us a framework in

which we operate safe

and green and for the future but it's

not solved no it's fine

but sometimes i wonder whether we do

have the right focus here because i mean

i would imagine like in 1992 rio

since then the emissions in europe

went down 27 percent in germany 40 but

in the whole world 55 or even more

annual up so i mean is it

is there a risk that we are not seeing

what is happening

outside our own country do we need an i

mean a broader perspective or

do you don't think so i don't think so

we have we have just

we have just had the the best experience

of all and that was the corona

experience

where you could no really i'm serious

you could see

what we're able to do everybody

around the globe and and uh if you're

willing to do it

and and that gives me hope that gives me

hope that people

stand up for before they believe in and

do the right thing

right here same perspective for you

well it absolutely i mean in a way yes

we have evidence that if we don't fly

anymore

we save three percent of the global

emissions if we consume less is another

two or three percent

but that's not the big wheel that i'm

talking about i'm talking about the

entire energy hunger that we have

and of course we can measure it there is

no other huge challenge or problem where

we can exactly measure all the time what

we are doing as humanity

and of course it's the sum of our

countries it doesn't really matter which

country is saving co2

it matters to the atmosphere and the

warming that co2 is saved

but we carry our load as you've said

correctly

germany has already used up its co2 part

in the atmosphere so to say so if we

continue as we do

we have to find partners who help us to

to have

not more of a co2 depth there are

solutions to that but it's all in the

politics

i would say and and there is a blind

spot i should say

there's a blind spot here and that is

the uh that is what we call streaming

what we're doing tonight

is extremely extremely

costly in energy and in co2

and i and i think it's a blind spot

because people don't want to see it

people don't want to see it because they

think it's it's all cool

the iphone is there everybody has a flat

rate

and and that there should be a price tag

on that because it's

it's nearly as much as uh as

as flight fuel that's true i mean there

are lots of blind spots but on the other

hand and unfortunately we have to finish

this wonderful discussion

uh the first time both of you on stage

and not not the last time i i hope

but but what my thoughts here are before

i

let you finish this part here is

i mean if things start moving

then they might suddenly move very fast

and that's the hope

i do have at the moment but now you

don't

reply to this because it's up to you now

i have a bunch of questions i would

still love to discuss with you i think

you raised such interesting topics also

about the ambivalence

of technology in the sense of maybe

having detracted our attention for the

past decades but this new generation

may be buying into a new value set also

because of dem

materialization and technology or the

correlation between

female education and stopping the world

population

grow again that intersection of feminism

climate change so i do also hope i agree

andreas that we can both get you back on

stage together

for a longer conversation soon and just

want to say thank you so much

for being here with us tonight and for

the work that you do

and all the best for the continuation of

that in the next

months and years thank you thank you so

now we're going to smoothly transition

into the fourth category the

announcement of the finalists into the

fourth

category and that is smart mobility and

transportation

for this i am excited to welcome back on

stage

virtually dr angela wilkerson secretary

general and ceo of the world energy

council

over to you angela

good evening to all of you once again it

is

a very exciting night and there's a real

sense of amazing possibilities as we

hear from the impressive energy startups

which have made it to the finalists in

their categories

there is a lot of talk these days about

the race to zero agenda

at the council we like to talk instead

about the races to zeroes

because there are multiple pathways in

multiple geographies

playing out across the world we know we

also need to work with sectors of the

economy which are hard to decarbonize

or can't yet be fully electrified

one of these of course is the

transportation sector

the excitement of faster electric cars

can sometimes distract from creative

approaches to infrastructure

public planning logistics user behaviors

shipping and freight and other modes of

transport which are also part

of the sustainable mobility future

this is why we created the smart

mobility and transportation category

i'm very pleased to announce the three

finalists which have made it

through to this category the first one

is craftwork tubes from germany

craftwork has developed a new compact

fuel cell

advanced sofc revolutionizing

the whole mobility sector it runs on

hydrogen and several hydrocarbons

the second finalist is chargex from

germany

the aqueduct system is designed for

charging in underground

uh parking garages and employee parking

lots

their solutions enable infrastructure

providers to set up and later scale up

large-scale charging infrastructure

affordably

and with little installation effort

and the third finalist in the smart

mobility and transportation category

is duct from estonia their

internationally painted

infrastructure solutions for micro

mobility provide a way to

dock lock and charge electric scooters

and other micro mobility vehicles

whether shared public or private in one

place

i wish the best of luck to all three

finalists and look forward to engaging

with all of you

in the coming months to join forces in

humanizing energy together

thank you so much angela and

congratulations

to the finalists

[Music]

oh

[Music]

hmm

[Music]

so

[Music]

[Music]

me

[Music]

so

[Music]

ladies and gentlemen just a quick

reminder that this is your

sort of last chance the next 15 to 20

minutes that we have the show

to send aim the machine your sound bites

so he can use them and create the final

piece of audio artwork that he's going

to share with us at the end of the night

so keep them coming

and now as we established we are facing

multi-dimensional challenges that also

require multi

perspectivity to achieve solutions so

it's not enough to focus down on energy

in a narrow sense we need a bigger

picture

which is why for our last interview

guest we are very excited to welcome

professor

maria chiara pastora she conducts

research on city development

and is also a special commissioner of

sisma an italian government initiative

for post reconstruction currently

she is working hand-in-hand with stefano

boeri

to integrate living nature in cities and

she's developing

urban forest strategies and what exactly

urban forest strategies are

maria is going to share with us now

before we begin with our conversation

we're going to see a short film that's

going to introduce her work

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

[Music]

such impressive images so welcome to the

show

maria it's great to have you with us

today

thank you so much i'm very happy thank

you so much

maria we just saw that beautiful

building can you tell us

where where that lives so

that building is uh the vertical forest

in milan

as it was opened up to the public in

2014 and

it's for us at the first prototype where

nature and architecture can structurally

be combined together

where uh that uh building hosts the 800

trees

and 5 000 shrubs and a number of

small birds have their nest

in the in the building so it's a kind of

a prototype also for

biodiversity so that's one of the

announcer

uh that we are trying to create

in a dance environment at the city of

milan it looks beautiful and it makes so

much sense

and i feel like we desperately need some

urban forestry here in berlin

i would love to learn how this

prototyping

worked is there a lot of convincing that

you have to do especially on a policy

level

when does when introducing these kind of

concepts of urban forestry

and piloting such buildings in in city

centers

so there i think that one of the main

issue is to

uh convince uh sometimes the client that

uh

the cost uh can be um

considerably uh balance by introducing

also living nature because

one of the main issue is then uh the

maintenance

of the building is it either

is there any structural issue that trees

can

can have but the um but the question is

we have done the first prototype in

milan

and then we are now working um in and

oven for example

and we have building and it's under

construction at the moment i think i can

show

uh some of the picture the i think that

you're um

you have it or it can move it i don't

know but

we have this building which is uh the

first experiment

of uh vertical forest uh with

social housing with the precast

concrete as a way of reducing the cost

so that's the the first prototype

and um in endowment so it's happening

now

and we have a precast concrete building

raising and the construction

site images show really that uh

that is also way to having trees

and nature embedded in the structure

with

reasonable costs maria just one question

i mean and these huge buildings are

spectacular certainly they're wonderful

and i i

imagine that it is a lot of work to

convince the people

majors and and planning to to get these

buildings buildings

done but you know i liked all the little

messages you had in the movie

on this big um building

and there i could see that but it

doesn't always

need to be such a huge building there

are so many options

to to have the ideas implemented in in

cities is

is that one part of your message as well

uh yeah the the overall projects uh

behind the the video uh was the

call to action because in 2018 we had

the pleasure to

uh be a co-organizer of the world

first world forum on urban forest so

we organized this event in order to have

a

very diverse background working together

uh

for a unique cause providing nature

and having nature in uh in the city

uh so this is uh this is the main

cause and uh buildings

are one of the most important elements

for us as architect in order to

rebring nature within our environment we

need to have

we have the technology the change we

need to do is to

convince the human that we are treat

that we need to have nature entries in

our environment

in a structural way yeah i mean and the

i think the building sector is really

getting into into the focus

right now because we see it's well not

so easy um to to change something

with existing buildings and we had us

online she was speaking at our

conference here

today and she was speaking about the

bauer house of the planet even

so a new way of thinking architecture

i mean do you see changes in city

planning i mean do you see

a different spirit coming up where ideas

like yours

are very much better received than maybe

like five years ago

it has been uh yes the pan and the the

world is changing

i think that uh one of the issues of

course

more uh awareness about climate change

but uh i also think that for example

european union

is uh creating us with the new green

deal

is creating a strong sense of

what is important in our city so uh we

are for example we are working in milan

and greater minan to uh

an urban strategy that has a huge claim

have three million trees in the city of

milan by 2030

and its program is called forestami and

the idea is not

to just uh that only the public is

working towards having

more green city but everybody so it's a

huge

issue also have to have people uh

in the same page and everybody on the

on the cause of greening the city and uh

for that we have been studying very

diverse city

melbourne paris uh new york

uh shanghai uh but also

freetown for example and all these

cities are now

launching this cause and the tree

campaign are really spurring all over

the world and i think that is

this is a very good sign trees cannot

arm our city so it's a very good sign a

positive sign of change

whilst we're on the topic of current

trends and changes

in urban planning i would love to ask

you

there's a lot of debate at the moment

about how covert is going to affect

city life and future and how we may

rethink our inner city centers

in terms of the balance between office

space

living space recreational space etc are

you already factoring that

into your work in some ways yes

one of the major issues that in italy we

had is that

during the lockdown we could not really

go into

huge green spaces so the proximity

of green spaces was a seminal and it is

seminal in our city

not everybody has uh the chance

to reach a park into the 300 meters

which was uh the kind of

uh covered the restriction that we had

at the time uh last year

so that was uh a very key point

so everybody should access to a green

space and i think that a lot of policies

need to change and will change in order

to have

continuous green spaces to change our

and to change the quality of our city so

that will be

important also for the urbanite island

it will be important for

the biodiversity very important to green

infrastructure but

also important for our life as humans

absolutely um you mentioned eindhoven

are there any other current projects

or things that you might like to feature

where you're where we can see some of

your work popping up next

oh yes it's in china we have

a two construction sites uh one gang in

eighteen

uh in tirana we are working

very much on schools

we have a huge master plan uh which is

called the riverside whether

the change uh it will be the first

postcode with a master plan which

will be of course considering

energy aspect and also uh the quality of

the green spaces for example and

in cancun we're now planning a forest

city

a where a space where nature is not just

embedded in the building but it is a

structural element

in the master plan maria thank you

very much for for joining us here i

think it

that fit perfect in what we're

discussing to

tonight multi-perspectivity we need

different perspectives

on the way we live in cities on the way

we act

and that was very very helpful thank you

very much and all the very best

regards to the whole team and you're

working with

thank you so much it's been it has been

a real pleasure

thank you so much bye bye bye

and ladies and gentlemen with that it's

already time for the final and fifth

category that we'll be announcing the

finalists for

tonight and that final category is

quality energy access and the

sustainable development goal

seven yes so we've just talked about

approaches to restructure

our cities with an outlook to a more

sustainable future

and i'm very excited to hear now our

startup technology can offer help to

really create access to people who may

be

cut off from energy today and creating

more equality across the globe

we've been talking a lot about the

seeing this as a whole world and a

global endeavor rather just focusing on

the locality and the countries that

we're in

individually and we have the perfect

person here to

present this final category and give the

speech and present the finalists tonight

as a former minister of social affairs

and former minister of the environment

nature protection and transportation of

the state of baden-wurttemberg

our presenter tania guerner is really an

expert on environmental issues

but at the same time she is also one of

the leading figures in germany for

development corporation

as since 2012 she's been the chairwoman

of the management board of the deutsche

gazelle shaft for international

international arbeit that's why we're

very honoured to have tanya gonna here

as part of the show tonight

and i must say that gizet she's heading

off

is also a strong partner of this project

we have many

projects from all over the world and and

we are very much

working together with the gis set so

thank you very much to the whole team

over there

good evening ladies and gentlemen what

an inspiring night

as chair of the management board of the

gizet deutsche gesellschaft for

internationality to summon albeit

i am thrilled to be a part of tonight's

celebration

of innovation in the energy sector the

gis

has long worked closely with the german

energy

agency as a proud partner for

accelerating

the global energy transition globally

i cannot wait to announce the three

remaining

finalists for the startup energy

transition awards

2021 climate action is needed from

everyone

policy makers citizens the

entrepreneurial community

the finalists that have just been

announced

are living proof that the energy

transition

can count on promising startups to shape

the future of clean energy

sustainable development poverty

reduction and climate policy

are closely linked at the chia zed

we seek to promote global economic

progress

while at the same time fostering social

justice

and the conservation of natural

resources

and ensuring that no one is left

behind the un sustainable development

goal 7

demands that we ensure access to

affordable reliable sustainable

and modern energy for all

this is an ambitious goal considering

that many people around the world don't

have

sufficient access to clean energy

innovative business models are needed

that challenge the

way in which we think about and

cooperate with rural areas

that so far remain disconnected from the

energy grid

this is why the category quality energy

excess

and 7 calls for startups that empower

communities

without further ado i am honored to

now announce this year's set finalists

for the category

quality energy xs and stg7

the first finalist is s4s

technologies from india the solar

conduction dryer they invented is an

electricity free solar solar-powered

food

dehydrator that reduces moisture content

in agro-produce so that farmers

and rural residents can preserve their

products

for up to one year without using

any chemicals

many boats were also given to a german

startup

borealite the company designs and

manufactures

affordable solar water desalination

systems for high quality water for

off-grid communities around the globe

i am happy to announce also nithio

holdings from the united states

as a finalist for the sdg 7 category

nitheo is an energy finance platform

that provides services to distributed

energy service companies

capital providers governments and other

stakeholders

in the distributed solar energy sector

in africa on behalf of gis

my warmest congratulations to the

finalists

thank you miss gonna thank you so much

andreas what an evening it's been i feel

that we did not promise our audience too

much when we said we have some really

special speakers here with us tonight at

least i really exchanged the dialogue

and exchange for perspectives on

multi-perspectivity with you and our

guests and i'm also really thrilled

about the finalists that we have for

this year's

set awards and can't wait till september

to find out who wins

yeah same for me and thank you very much

all of you for

joining us and thanks for all the

startups applying in this award because

it's

core of the whole project thanks for our

wonderful speakers

i think we met many by the way mostly

women huh

on stage and also in the internet on

on a virtual basis so for me it was a

pleasure i learned a lot

and uh i like to work and learn a lot

on conferences like this same here same

here so i hope everybody's really

enjoyed tonight and who would have

thought that the hardest party in town

is happening at the hubstat

residence dodge telecom but it

definitely is so

now we're excited to hear what audio

samples you sent in

and what in the machine did with that

and so let's

dance it out have a great evening

everybody and see you in september

but before we go to the music maybe

tomorrow there's a second part of the

conference as you know so i would like

to invite you on behalf of the german

government to really join

enjoy this conference and also meet

people in the formats we do have

business to dialogue conferences

startup pitches there's so many

activities in this berlin energy week

once again thank you very much and here

we go
