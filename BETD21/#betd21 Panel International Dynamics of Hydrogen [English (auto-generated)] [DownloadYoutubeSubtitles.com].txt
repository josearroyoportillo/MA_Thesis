today we'll be talking about the

international dynamics of hydrogen

in the international context energy has

always been a key issue due to national

interests and security

the interplay between exporting and

importing fossil fuels

heavily influences the political and

economic relationships between countries

meanwhile the reality of climate change

is forcing the international community

to explore cleaner more sustainable

forms of energy

which may lead to a reshuffling of

traditional energy partnerships

and impact international trade relations

all of this could bring about new

structures of cooperation

and competition when it comes to green

hydrogen

how will countries respond to and

capitalize on this reconfiguration of

international energy relations

uh as with our other sessions ladies and

gentlemen we'll use our virtual platform

to engage with you our audience members

and we'll also have a chance to pose

some of your questions

to our panel we have two rounds of

discussion

which will be on the great hydrogen

shift redrawing the international energy

landscape and hydrogen

as a source of national security and now

to our very distinguished panelists

i'll keep introductions here brief so

that we have as much time as possible to

chat with one another

and to our speakers uh when we get there

let's please be sure to keep your

remarks to two minutes or under

joining me today are omar paganini the

minister of industry

energy and minds in uruguay dr kirsten

westphal

head of the project git h2 and a senior

analyst for global issues division

at the german institute for

international and security affairs

swp dr jorge rivera staff

the energy secretary of panama and

professor dr tatiana mitrova

head of research at the skol kovo energy

center

panelists thank you so much for joining

me we'll also have a pre-recorded video

statement later in the program from inna

marie ericsson

surryda the minister of foreign affairs

for norway

um to my panelists thank you all for

joining us and i'm going to go ahead and

start things off with a question

for our virtual audience do you think a

shift to a hydrogen-based economy will

lead to

um a a reconfiguration and diversif

diversification of the existing energy

landscape in favor of new smaller state

players

b a consolidation of existing energy

alliances and competitions in favor of

traditional

resource rich countries or c neither

a shift to a hydrogen based energy

economy is not feasible

i can see that some of you have already

put in your uh your

your ideas i would encourage you to do

more of the same and we'll get back to

those results

in just a little while but right now i'd

like to get to round one

so for my panelists

can a future hydrogen economy disrupt

the hegemony of resource risk

research resource rich states and

democratize the energy landscape and if

so

how dr restful uh i'd like to ask you to

respond first

thank you very much jennifer good to be

here um i think yes if we talk about the

hegemony

what is at stake of course

the lead markets right now are the oil

markets and there we've seen in the past

years the big three

the us saudi arabia and russia and of

course this structure will

change tremendously whether it will be a

democratization

i don't know i would rather see a

regionalization

and what i think is we will see a shift

in the energy landscape for sure and the

interesting

thing is that the mode will change i

think it's more

politics that will really influence um

the partners so the choice is political

thank you very much uh and dr rivera

staff would you like to respond to that

question as well

such a greetings from panama from our

president

cortisone of course our foreign minister

erica muenes we are we're really excited

to be here you know we have

uh we are looking for a achieved a

complete shift

in the geopolitical discussion

and your political positions around the

energy issues

as we have mentioned not only

about green hydrogen but also on

renewables

on the access to technology on the

access to

all the resources that have been

democratic democratizing

the access to these resources it's

really really different

from the uh history that we have been

looking and receiving in the last uh

around 100 years it's a big shift and

it's

it has the chance to democratize the

opportunities for everyone where we are

we are moving actually from a global

commodity from oil transactions to

regional markets

uh and hydrogen is part of that and also

electricity so we have

we think that we are in the middle uh of

a big shift in the demonstration is a

it's a it's a really statement that we

have to get ready for that

all the stakeholders thank you very much

uh i'd like to ask you we've you both

spoke about regionalization

um and regional markets and now i want

to ask something about

those resource-rich countries how do you

think they're going to react to the

changes in order to safeguard their

status as energy exporters of the

future uh dr mitrova

yes thank you so much and it's great to

be here i mean

uh hydrogen is very controversial topic

because indeed on one hand as the

destination as the final destination

we can expect that with different colors

of hydrogen there might be

stronger competition and more

democratization the problem is that the

route towards this destination can take

decades and actually if you look at the

current projects which are being

undertaken by different resource-rich

countries they

are all state-led and um

actually led by state corporations so in

this respect

russia is not an exclusion uh we see

gas chrome we see rosatom uh similarly

to saudi aramco and

other large players which are trying to

step into this completely new very

unclear uh business uh and

uh to build their expertise uh

in order to have some um

second option in case if traditional

hydrocarbons are no longer demanded by

the market

so hydrogen is mostly regarded in the

resource-rich countries as a sort of

substitute

to the traditional hydrocarbon exports

expensive sophisticated substitute which

needs

massive state support and funding by the

way

on the first stages just to scale it up

and to build

the whole technological chain and supply

chain

and um actually i don't

think that um we will see

really fast transition of these players

towards

hydrogen economy and hydrogen society

because most of these expectations most

of these hydrogen plants

are targeted not of the domestic markets

but for

exports and you can imagine that

this this division between domestic

market which can

remain quite dirty and hydrogen and

based on hydrocarbons

and green exports it doesn't look like a

sustainable mix

thank you very much dr mitrova and mr

paganini uh

how do you think that resource rich

countries will react to these changes in

order to safeguard their status as

energy exporters

of the future

oh i'm terribly sorry uh mr paganini i

think you might be on mute

do you hear me i hear you okay

thank you well it's great to be here

it's really

great to be taking part of this panel

and

this very interesting topic that is

strategic for our country uruguay i will

not get into the shoes of a hydrocarbon

rich resource countries but different

kinds of resource

rich countries that are the renewable

resources for its countries

as you know urubai has already 98

of the electricity generation in

renewables

50 hydro then wind 30 percent

and then some solar and biomass

so we are in a region brazil why

argentina

chile that is really

capable of generating green hydrogen

in much more quantities than we are able

to

to use ourselves of course it's

strategic for us to develop our own

capability to use hydrogen and of course

this is a long-term

project but i think the world would

reconfigure between

countries that are able to have more

renewable resources than

they are able to to use in their demand

and they will be exporters even though

of course we cannot base our own

development only in exports and this is

a long-term thing because we have to

figure out the logistics if it's liquid

hydrogen if it's ammonia if it's

methanol or whatever it is and you need

infrastructure to do this and these are

large investments and the state

has to play a part of course but i think

the world would

will reconfigure from different kind of

of commerce flows regarding energy with

hydrogen

green hydrogen development thank you

very much

that's dr mitrova and mr paganini both

speaking about logistics and

infrastructure and

state support and funding i would like

to move to around this an open

discussion question for all of you with

the dovetails nicely

nicely with an audience question we've

just received so

when considering the importance of the

future global hydrogen economy

where do you see potential new

international conflict lines arising

where do you see new alliances and how

can small countries be major players

when it comes to hydrogen dynamics

considering the costs the scale and the

advanced technology that's involved

i'll open the floor to you

please mr rivers yeah thank you i would

like to

to take that question uh in order to to

have some

ideas of what we are looking here in

panama

we are thinking about the future of

green hydrogen of course this

international trade these regional

markets that are being developed

so we are working in our national

transition agenda

energy transition agenda to develop a

road map for hydrogen but

mostly focused not on the development of

the producing the hydrogen

in the short term or using the hydrogen

we are working

to add value to these regional markets

this global trade

of uh between hydrogen it's in it

becoming

a hop a regional hub for hydrogen that's

the the what we are you know uh

looking for in the next years we already

are

bunkering and hydrocarbons regional hub

we are a logistics hub we are transport

stop we have a communications and

financial hub so we

think that we have the the the elements

to pass the development of

our regional hyper hydrogen so we have

terminals for

um hydrocarbons that could be repurposed

for the use of uh

and storage and transport of hydrogen so

this is what we are

looking for we are a small country we

have this chance we have this role

and we think we can go ahead with this

and serve to the count to the region

in this manner not only in the

generation on the production of the

hydrogen

or the use of the of the hydrogen but in

the middle the transport and the

logistics and the storage of the

of this new commodity thank you very

much dr rivera staff

i'd like to give our other panelists the

opportunity to respond to that question

we are looking at the potential new

interco international conflict lines and

alliances and

how do we get small countries to be a

part of these

if i may please mr paganini

from this house we see ourselves

as our a supplier producer of hydrogen

green hydrogen in the future because we

are equidistant from the

main demanding on cities europe

and asia pacific so i think we have a

role there in

a different configuration of energy

commerce in the world but maybe we

in a long transition put less pressure

on the existing

hubs of energy generation that is

a hydrocarbon rich countries and will

slowly go changing to a more regional

thing but maybe than where south america

plays a different role not only in the

logistics of course

panama and uruguay are small countries

that can be hubs of different things

panama is already

a very renowned hub but we are

in the entrance of river plate we can be

a hub between argentina brazil paraguay

et cetera

but also because we are a region where

that can be

able to supply other regions so i think

we will see reconfiguring

with alliances between europe and south

america maybe

to to secure a long-term

of taking of our green hydrogen maybe

also alliance with japan

and a different configuration of the

world markets as i said

in just a moment i'd like to check in

with our slider results but i wanted to

make sure

dr westphal did you have i think i saw

you raise your hand yes please

yeah thank you very much also to add i

think from

a european point of view you indeed see

a number of demand centers with

europe certainly being one needing a lot

of imports but also

asia pacific and in in that regard i i

would like to stress what tatiana

said it's it's going to be a transition

and the transition might be quite

painful

also with regard to um making the

transition

as smooth as possible i think that's not

an easy task because it's not

only substitutes import export ties from

a european perspective

but there's rather really the challenge

that we might see a relocation

of basic industries for example and then

it becomes

really not only a task of energy

transformation

but indeed an industrial transition

so i think the geo economics are

something to to watch

closely and the other point is um

again it's it's a transition where i

would see a development in concentric

circles around the regional demand

centers

and the big challenge being maybe

comparable to what we've seen in the gas

markets to moving from a regional market

with slow diversification into a global

market

but this will really take time in

particular if we

we look into very

selected market segments like just green

hydrogen i think for

a transitional period we should look

into

a carbon friendly carbon neutral um

hydrogen in order also to kick of the

industries in

in europe and the big challenge is

really bringing in more diversity and

this is not a foregone

thank you very much and dr mitrov yes

you as well yeah

thank you look uh the problem i i want

to raise

also the question of regulation and

institutional framework

because so far there is no market for

hydrogen

you cannot quote the price for hydrogen

there are no

standard contracts for hydrogen supply

and there are no investment guarantee

investment return guarantees

for the investments in the whole

hydrogen supply chain

which is extremely expensive to be frank

it's much more expensive

rather than to build a traditional gas

supply chain

so uh in this situation

i'm afraid that the whole development of

the hydrogen market and hydrogen hubs

as kirsten mentioned uh it will actually

repeat the fate of the gas market

development in 1950s 1960s

with bilateral inter-government

long-term agreements with fixed price

and really strong guarantees of

investment return

it's not a sport market yeah and in this

respect

creating competitive environment will be

probably the biggest challenge

if you look at saudi japanese uh

relations at

uh relations between australia and japan

for example

this is all made on the very top level

with long-term commitment with

co-investment

from both sides it's really building a

bilateral

hydrogen bridge between two countries

and it involves a really

uh very strong geopolitical commitment

yeah because in order to engage with a

counterparty for the next

20 50 years um you have to be more or

less convinced

that you want to be in one boat together

uh moreover i think uh it is also

becoming clear that

all the regulation which applies

currently to the liberalized natural gas

markets

it will not be applicable to the

hydrogen markets again because the

um initial investments are

so huge that uh nobody is ready to

go for such such a risk of

just putting hydrogen on the spot market

and these

all will create a lot of additional

tensions

and problems and also need for these

bilateral relations which is probably

not the best way to proceed

in the world which is already getting a

bit too much polarized

thank you so much dr mitrova uh we're

going to look at those hydrogen markets

in just a second but first

i would like to look at the results of

our audience poll

do you think a shift to a hydrogen-based

econo energy economy will lead to

a reconfiguration and diversification of

the existing energy landscape in favor

of new smaller state players coming in

with 60 of the vote and 33 of you

said a consolidation of existing energy

alliances and competitions

in favor traditional resource-rich

countries

some interesting audience input there we

have another round of questions

for our panelists um but i would like to

first have another question

for our audience out there and that's

our second slido question

how important is the production and

import of hydrogen to your country's

future energy security it's a multiple

choice question

your options are very important somewhat

important

less important or not at all relevant

and we'll get back

to those audience responses in just a

little bit but i'd like to go to round

two

of our question and answer session which

will begin with a video statement

from the honorable inna marie ericsson

serraida

minister of foreign affairs for norway

dear friends and colleagues fighting

climate change

and promoting climate neutral growth are

two of the defining tasks of our time

we need a global energy transition if we

are to reach the goals of the paris

agreement and the sustainable

development goals

the european green deal presents an

important road map and norway will

contribute

to its implementation both in europe and

beyond

hydrogen can be an effective way to

decarbonize the energy sector

and norway believes it is essential that

governments take a technology

neutral approach what matters is that we

are able to produce

enough volumes of clean low emission

hydrogen

at the lowest possible cost and this is

best achieved by competitive energy

markets with carbon pricing

the possible emergence of a hydrogen

economy will influence geopolitical

dynamics

and let me briefly mention three issues

first hydrogen can reshape the global

map of energy

a new class of exporters and importers

can emerge

and new trade and shipping lanes may

gain importance

second as hydrogen can be produced

almost

everywhere in the world and since

hydrogen can be stored

this makes it almost impossible for

exporters to use hydrogen

as a political tool and third

new leaders of technology may arise

early movers in the hydrogen industry

might be able to sell their technology

to the rest of the world

and gain considerable influence in the

process

it's very difficult to predict which

role hydrogen will play in the energy

transition yet it is crucial that we

prepare

for the geopolitical implications of the

new energy age

the global energy transition requires

extensive global cooperation

investment and innovation and sometimes

tough political choices

the berlin energy transition dialogue

allows policy makers

industry leaders and civil society to

share ideas

so that we make informed and

forward-looking choices

that's the only way we can move towards

climate neutrality

in a safe affordable and environmentally

friendly way

thank you thank you very much to you

minister eriksen sorry of norway and now

we're going to look at some of those

geopolitical issues

in this next section hydrogen is a

source

of national security i'd like to direct

my next question first to dr rivera

staff and then to mr paganini

what role does hydrogen play in national

security both from the perspective

of an energy importer and uh from that

of an energy exporter

dr rivera staff thank you very much

that's a key issue and a key question

we have to look at uh we have to

to separate the shorter the mid and the

long term

issues that we are dealing with the

hydrogen as we have been

talking in this panel we have a lot of

uh

lessons to learn from development from

the development

the past years from a natural gas

uh consolidation of markets we have a

lot of to learn through that

and of course we have a huge difference

within that process and the process that

we are looking right now

is the climate change commitment to

fight against this this kind of

challenges that we have ahead so

security and national security for

for our energy development energy

procurement

energy production uh of course it has to

play a role

because we have the chance uh little

countries like like panama

that net importers of oil and

hydrocarbons

to to change that to to have this

transition

and of course as i mentioned we are

looking in the short term

to develop a hub of uh regional markets

in the americas and maybe

related with asia and europe for a

hydrogen produced here

and to the export but of course we are

looking for we have a roadmap

for that in the midterm to become

a producer of a green hydrogen

coming from renewables but of course we

are the

the thing that we have uh certainly we

have the objectives

we have set the goals for that and we

have the discussions the dialogue like

the one we are having right now in order

to develop the

the best way according of course

to this climate change fight we have

everything

and everyone on board thank you very

much

dr river staff of panama i'd like to ask

the same question now

of mr paganini in uruguay what role does

hydrogen play in the in national

security

mr paganini i think you might be unmute

i'll try not to be boring because the

situation of uruguay and panama is quite

similar

we are also net oil importers for very

long time we don't have

our own resources we had a big issue

in electricity regarding imports from

argentina or from

even a further away and we changed that

with a big investment in wind power and

solar power

so so now we are going forward to try to

decarbonize transportation and there we

have two two

two vectors the hydrogen for long term

and for cargo and for

urban battery electricity electricity

or battery electric vehicles so that's

our goal

to be independent from energy oil

in in the medium term and that is good

for us and for national security

also we want to play a role regarding

the capability of producing

energy and also the going through

the learning curve of the technology

that we can be leaders in in the south

of america

in that sense we have a roadmap in

construction

in dialogue with the civil society and

with industry and with the government

we are in that process now and we will

start a pilot

in a pilot project in montevideo uruguay

this year where there will be a

private public project with

with public investment but also with the

the

the building of private in a consortium

that can be

they can carry on the project and also

turn it into a profitable business model

for transportation and maybe for also

green

green fertilizing because we we are

conscious that we cannot only aim at

exports in the long term

in the short term we have to aim at the

uses of hydrogen

in in our country of course this is

complementary with other transformations

such as as i said

the electric vehicle thing and and this

we see it as a

step forward in national security and

independence and also

a strengthening of a role in the region

a region that has been volatile

in financial issues and also

is quite asymmetric in energy resources

so we want to play a part there too

thank you

thank you very much minister paganini my

next question will be for

dr vestfall and dr mitrova and i'll ask

you to speak of course on the

perspective from your respective

countries of germany and russia

uh what conditions for the export or

import of hydrogen would best serve your

respective countries national interests

dr restful

this is a very i mean it's a very

difficult

question because indeed we have to think

about different time

frames as it has been said by the

minister of panama

and i think in short term it is really

an issue to work on a smooth

transition which of course

also brings in the the traditional

suppliers of oil and gas

and to work with them on a smooth

transition because we have that really

a lot of potential conflicts looming

i also think given the fact that really

it's an issue of

long-term ties of building up hydrogen

import export ties it's really building

a geopolitical

bridge as tatiana mitrova said i i have

really

a favor for looking first

into countries that

have a similar or

harmonized regulatory framework

where we share certain standards and

noise

so i would really see the european

neighborhood of something to move on and

move forward

also with the european energy community

for example with the european economic

area

like norway where where we have common

ties

common infrastructure but also as i said

shared noise

but then of course it's also an issue of

a flexible geometry

to work with countries that are first

movers that

are important to work on on this

governance issue

like for example partners in

south south america or australia

but i think it's really a an issue of a

flexible geometry

thank you very much dr vespal and dr

mitrova uh what conditions for the

export or import of hydrogen

would best serve your country's national

interests

i think uh it can work uh it can really

become

something considerably uh large

uh only if there will be uh

quite an intensive international

cooperation i mean

uh these uh hydrogen export projects

they cannot be realized by any single

country or any single company alone

simply because they are very capital and

technology

intensive if you look right now in all

the countries which uh have hydrogen

strategies and which are

actively moving in this direction uh

there are hydrogen consoles

the companies are actually unifying

their

efforts working together even competing

companies technology providers for

example

they are working together uh

because otherwise it is uh

too expensive too difficult too long

for them to reach any visible result

and so i completely agree with kirsten

that uh

in this respect creating a sort of

pan-european

uh corporation and some network

would be really beneficial for everybody

not just to duplicate

these efforts r d expenditures

and uh everything else and uh

frankly uh i i would say i cannot see

russian hydrogen exports expanding

without a specially dedicated eu

russia program or platform or whatever

because russia itself is definitely not

ready to invest

massive amount of money in building from

its

end uh like it did with the

north stream or torque stream new

infrastructure new upstream investments

in hydrogen the previous experience with

gas frankly was too disappointing

thank you very much dr mitrov let's

let's stick with the question of

of of infrastructure and this is an open

question again for all of our panelists

so what role does the existing energy

infrastructure for production

for transportation and for distribution

play in

any country's ability to build and

operate a viable hydrogen economy

which if you would like to address that

first

dr westfall i'd love to call on you

first

i think it's both it's a legacy but it's

also of course an

asset and then it depends whether we are

talking about electricity

grass electric grids might be very

important for

a certain locations for water

electrolysis

and and here the point is really that

this is also a constraining factor in

europe

why we will have to look into a lot of

experts because

we have constraints both on i would say

social acceptance but also

on um well the country

um where we cannot build extensively

um solar and and and wind

power um and so that's the point on the

electric grids but also

of course the gas grid can be an asset

also international pipelines of course

and this is why i think it's very

important to look into the relationship

with the traditional suppliers because

i would also think that in terms of

climate policies

it's really important to co-opt the old

traditional fossil fuel suppliers and

and we also expected your political

dividend from that

um if we work with russia if we work

with arteria for example

so that's that's really a point where we

can use infrastructure

but i think we will also see a

decommissioning

of gas pipelines as well

thank you dr westphal i think i saw you

raise your hand

dr rivera staff would you like to also

address that question please the floor

is yours

thank you actually that's one of the

things that we're looking in our in the

construction and development of our

roadmap for hydrogen as i mentioned we

are we already have a

logistics hub for uh hydrocarbons

here in panama related to the panama

canal activities

so we are looking for that we we have

been looking about the the thing of the

the issue

of stranded assets in the midterm of

this hydrocarbon

uh oil and natural gas

infrastructure so we have we have the

chance to repurpose

all this infrastructure to the the use

and

uh to add value to the hydrogen value

chain so

in that in that issue but also we have

the as as you mentioned the the

electricity grips

and the renewable capacity that we have

in our country how to

that that infrastructure related to the

electric to it

is going to be related also and and

dedicated to the

hydrogen production for an insulin

dr rivera staff i want to check now with

our two other panelists and see if they

would like to respond

to that question dr mitrova would you

like to

please with great pleasure uh

infrastructure

is always uh the bottleneck the

constraint for

any market development because it

is uh implying massive upfront

investments

and it is also linking the partners

even lng infrastructure with natural gas

uh it is uh it means that there should

be co-investors that there should be

some partnership

and consortium uh created in order to

move ahead

and so in this respect uh this uh

hydrogen infrastructure

i think it will be not an easy task to

create it from a scratch

of course there are lots of ideas how to

use the existing

uh natural gas infrastructure gas

pipelines um

but um anyway there should be some

additional investments additional

insulation

and different compressors so lots of

technological issues

which should be fixed before we can

really switch

uh the existing pipelines uh to

hydrogen pipelines when it comes to the

uh green hydrogen which in many cases

doesn't have any connection

with the natural gas infrastructure then

it's even more challenging uh question

because

it is located in the different areas uh

there is this geographical gap

uh between them and so uh and there is

no expertise actually in the within

electricity generating companies on how

to work with the gases

which is quite a different business so

um

again i think there could be some

overlap there could be

some utilization of the existing

capacitors what we cannot count on that

as the main road uh i think

it's much more reasonable to expect

that are there there will be a need for

massive

new construction massive new

infrastructure

because at the end of the day the gas

infrastructure that we have right now

uh it was mainly built like 30 50 years

ago

and it needs a lot of investment just to

for maintenance and repair yeah

so i'll step on that thank you dr

mitrova

before we get to our audience poll

results i did want to offer

minister paganini the option to reply to

this question

yes very shortly we agree the

infrastructure is one of the key issues

in the new value chain very important

oops do you hear me

yes because okay very important for

for development and it's mainly a new

infrastructure

boards pipes ships

it's huge investments and also there's

an issue regarding which is the best

carrier if we are going through

liquid ammonia we're going to low hc

if we are going for it with liquid

hydrogen and all this

has to restore digestion yet and decided

by the market

and it will take many years if we go

to a liquid ammonia carrying for example

we can think not of using pipelines but

of using

trucks or ships or whatever and we have

to

take care of special maybe security

issues in the cities

but there is maybe a more

straightforward way to go that that way

that

if we wait for liquid hydrogen or or

if we just think that we are going to

deal with the existing

gas pipelines i think that's only the

start of the thing but it would take

a huge new development and that's a

the big challenge of all of this in the

electric

electricity network great side maybe

things are easier

there is some issues regarding how to

deal with an electrolyzer

massive electrolyzing because it's not

just

let's get the exceeding electricity

and by night we we put in the system a

very big demand

for electrolyzing and that turns around

the way

you manage the network but i think

that's not

so big an issue as the rest of the

logistics

uh just to mention one thing

if you go to green hydrogen well maybe

the combination of wind and solar for

example is a very good combination

to to to get a high power factor

and utilization factor of the

electrolyzer

and that is not so if you only are using

solar

or you can use electrolyzer only in

daylight of course

so that's why i think south america has

a role because it can combine

green technologies to to have green

hydrogen but that's just a side note on

the issue

thank you thank you very much mr

paganini now i would like to check in

with those results from our audience

poll as a reminder that question was how

important is the production and import

of hydrogen to your country's future

energy security

more than half of you responded very

important about a quarter of you

somewhat important

and the remaining corner quarter less

important or not at all

relevant thank you to our audience

members so much for your participation

in this poll panelists we have just

around five minutes left

and i'd like to ask you all to respond

to the next question

and unfortunately to keep your answers

brief so that we can be sure to close

this panel out with enough time to head

back

to the veldzil the question is we've

talked a lot about

green hydrogen what concrete steps do we

need to take

so that we're sure that it's green

hydrogen and it's not brown hydrogen or

it's not an excuse to to just use more

fossil fuels to produce hydrogen

why don't we go ahead and start with mr

paganini

please keep responsible shorts yes of

course

we need we need a certification we need

blockchain technology maybe we need

the kind of thing that assures that the

the electricity you're using is

electricity coming from

green generation pretty sure thank you

very much

mr fagenini uh dr mitrova

yeah uh i couldn't agree more

certification third-party audit

and a really very transparent

reporting and disclosure of all

steps of this hydrogen production

because otherwise consumers will have

simply no

trust to it thank you very much dr

mitrov dr rivera staff

concrete steps i agree with

with the two panelists that we do we

need

certifications and standards for of

origin

and for transport of the old of the root

of the hydrogen these standards are

really a step

to have to in order to develop regional

or global

markets of import and export of hydrogen

or green hydrogen

thank you very much dr rivera staff and

to close us out

dr westphal concrete steps

i i agreed to the previous speakers

and if we need and because of the fact

that we need certification

third-party audits very close monitoring

and reporting

there's a big issue about international

governance and the

question which organization will set the

standards

or who will go first and this is

certainly something

to select um the other point i would

really like to make it's

first of all it's really about carbon

neutrality

and climate friendliness so i think we

have a pathway

towards green hydrogen with maybe other

colors so the issues not the colors but

the carbon content

good final comments from our four

panelists omar paganini dr christine

westfall

dr jorge rivera staff and dr tatiana

mitrova

joining us for this exciting panel on

the international dynamics of hydrogen

thank you so much to the four of you for

joining us for this afternoon

and thank you to all of our audience

members who were here with us in the

europassal
