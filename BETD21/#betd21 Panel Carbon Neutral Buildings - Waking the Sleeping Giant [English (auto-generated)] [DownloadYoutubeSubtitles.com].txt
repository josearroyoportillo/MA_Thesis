hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome

to this live stream two from the

europassal

the title of our session is carbon

neutral buildings waking the sleeping

giant

eu commissioner president eu commission

president ozala fonda lyon mentioned the

sector earlier in her keynote speech

this morning

and joining me now to take a closer look

at this topic are

martina otto head of the cities unit for

the un

environment program and head of the

global abc secretariat

marisol orophasa creator and coordinator

of heat changers initiative

and business and marketing strategist

for matters mx

and anne rosenberg senior vice president

for sustainable development at wood

plc thank you all so very much for

joining me this this afternoon and it's

lovely to have you here

i would like to get things though

started first with a question for our

audience

when we discuss the energy transition

today we think

primarily of electricity and mobility

but we rarely consider this sleeping

giant in our title

the building sector our first question

to you audience members

and panelists you're also welcome to

take part in this poll is a yes or no

question

what challenges ah actually this is an

open-ended question

which challenges must be overcome in

your country in order to wake the

sleeping

giant the building sector we will get

those

answers in and we'll come back and look

at those results in just a moment or two

but now i'd like to go to our panelists

we'll start with a statement from

martina otto on the global abc

annual status report 2020. the floor is

yours ms otto

thank you very much and it's a pleasure

to be with you

and tell you a little bit while we're

talking about

the sleeping giant and that is with a

few figures

coming out of the global alliance for

buildings and construction global status

report

that was released um only recently uh

it is that the buildings and

construction sector is not on track for

achieving the paris agreement climate

goals

it uh has seen actually the highest co2

emissions ever recorded with around 10

gigatonne co2 from the operations of

buildings

and once we add 3.5 gigatons for

buildings and construction

um from the construction industry um for

example for our standard building

materials with cement steel and glass

the sector's share increases to 38

percent of total global

energy related to it co2 emissions and

that's something

that's not negligible and as you pointed

out we look off net energy

and transport by buildings is a big

ticket item

what is interesting to note is that

while we saw emissions rise

the total final energy consumption of

the global building sector

actually remains stable and that shows

us that there is a little bit of

decoupling of emissions from the

additional floor space

that is kicking in the co2 increase is

due to a continued use of coal

oil and natural gas for heating and

cooking combined with

higher activity levels in regions where

electricity remains carbon intensive

so to state the obvious the electrific

electrification trend

is not solving everything and it's

necessary

um to look behind the doors of the

electrification

as well and on top of that comes the

projected doubling of floor space by

2060 or

in other words the addition of floor

space of the paris

every week and that means that obviously

our

construction materials and with that the

embodied carbon

is set to rise and that means that we do

need a triple strategy to drive down

both

energy demand and emissions and that

means we need to

drastically reduce energy demands in

buildings we need to implement material

strategies that reduce life cycle

emission

carbon emissions and we need to

decarbonize the power sector

and maybe one more set of trends that's

coming from the finance side

um and for the well between last year

and this year we

uh did see an increase of

the incremental investments in building

energy efficiency of three percent

um but of course at 152 billion us

dollars

um against uh 5.8 trillion us dollars

spent on buildings and construction

this is small and way too small and um

but at the same time the finance

institutions and properly developed

property developers have started to

recognize the market

of energy efficient uh buildings and for

example green mortgages

and green bonds are also on the rise

and another sign of hope uh to talk

about well the select

the giant waking up is that the private

sector companies have started to use

science-based targets as well

um that's methodology uh to make certain

carbon commitments

and what it comes down to is um we know

what to do

and we can do it even with existing

technologies

but we actually need to scale up and to

increase

the pace as well we have two key

opportunities this year

one is and that sort of uh if ever you

can talk about the silver lining of

covet

19 of the pandemic but it does provide

an opportunity to build back better

literally and the constructor the

construction sector has a real critical

role

with higher than most sectors job

creation potential and here the

renovation wave needs to kick in so

that's a real opportunity

um to to to set us a bit better on track

and the other one is the nationally

determined contributions that are not to

be missed and i'm coming to the end

um because only a share of countries

have actually recognized the buildings

in this but um there is such a huge

opportunity

and uh well as we go to glasgow uh we

need to

uh to to actually use them and it's

really time to wake up the

the sleeping giant thank you thank you

very much miss otto

uh why don't we go now to marisol

orapesa who has a statement about solar

thermal applications

and integration with other renewables ms

ora pesa

thank you very much i'm very happy to be

here and to have this

wonderful panel yes indeed it's a

challenging

um thing to do for decarbonizing

our world because buildings have

different size architecture

insulation geographical location also a

physical location where

actually the building is placed what

type of

energy supply does it have what are the

patterns of consumption also according

to region or to country it varies

a lot so for us i think it would be wise

to think first

as martina just mentioned energy

performance of building has to be

improved we have to make buildings as

efficient as possible

and for this there are plenty of options

i think there is a lot of awareness

about

energy efficiency for buildings talking

about smart buildings

including smart cities how do we do this

very good but this depends also a lot on

the region it's different what

um europe has been doing um compared to

what mexico is doing for instance

there are also different political

backgrounds and policy aspects

which have worked in some countries

better than in others so i guess first

we have to learn from each other that

energy efficiency first works of course

also because it's a matter of investment

why why do we need to waste energy why

do we need to pay for wasted energy

so i guess this is one of the messages

that we need to to spread a bit stronger

because it's also an investment and an

opportunity for

property owners to reduce their cost and

increase the value of their

property on the other side or secondly

we need to

upgrade the buildings with energy

produced on-site from renewable sources

from renewable sources which are not

contaminated or which are having a

carbon footprint much lower than the

current energy source

and for this i agree there are plenty of

technologies available in the market

which has very cost effective

ranging from different types of uh

renewable sources

beginning with solar thermal which is

the infinite resource that we have which

costs nothing

we need to to invest in the technology

but for these there are different

options around the world

which cover different needs because here

we are talking about

hot water space heating and cooling

and for all these purposes there are

different technologies which are very

suitable

also according to the location of the

building or of the

energy patterns consumption patterns we

have also

biomass which is of course a renewable

energy source

where the power to be combined also for

instance with solar thermal we have heat

pumps

which is also very good combination um

um

very popular in europe for instance

using thermal energy

uh solar thermal energy in combination

with with heat pumps and here we can

also think of a

power um coming from renewable sources

like pv for instance but there is also

um geothermal very traditional in some

countries

and also very important in europe and

growing now

district heating networks district

hitting and cooling networks

are a great chance to reach of course

more people it's much easier to supply

heat through the

also say a clean heat through the

existing

networks than convincing individual

property owners to

upgrade their buildings with any

renewable energy source

so here i guess that the option that all

these renewable energy technologies give

us is that they can make our decision

more flexible

in terms of what kind of technology are

we going to use which combination

but the key factor is to know what's the

maximal use of renewable energy what

combination gives us the

best what combination help us to

have an optimal reduction of co2 and

also with the least infrastructure

meaning also space available and

uh well the investment depending on the

type of technology and the size of the

systems we are talking about high or

medium or relatively slow

low investment cost and of course the

current energy supply and the prices

make the renewables more competitive or

less so here we also need to

think about the political aspect the

policy support the subsidies that are

being

reduced also in some countries to the

fossil fuels

making uh more competitive the use of

renewable heating and cooling

technologies

and last but not least we need to think

of also the

increase that all these use of

technologies give us in terms of energy

security

you you have seen perhaps you have been

aware of the fact of these climatic

conditions it's not only

that okay fossil fuels are um high

harbor carbonized but we also have very

climatic conditions which are affecting

energy supply recently there was this

snow problem in texas which affected the

gas supply to mexico for instance so

mexico is depending on

gas imports from the united states and

there were huge problems because

we couldn't have access so many of the

cities couldn't have access to

to gas so we need to increase the

on-site generation of

energy from renewable er sources

at a cost-effective price but also

wisely thinking

that increases the energy independence

and also the quality of the energy that

we

are becoming so from my side um

as a solar thermal fellow i would like

to

to see more this solar district heating

networks i like to see more combination

of solar thermal with heat pumps

not only in europe which is the main

market but also abroad

and of course in cities or in countries

where the solar radiation is extremely

good

and the heating demand is much larger

than another much easier to meet

with renewable energy sources solar

thermal is of course

one of the best technologies available

and last but not least just to finish my

statement

i like to raise the issue about

awareness

from the consumer side we have seen now

more interaction between the internet of

things

and renewable energy technologies so i

guess that this is a very good chance

to get to the consumers and to make them

aware of the fact of how much energy

they can stop consuming with energy

efficiency measures

and how much green energy they can get

from renewable sources

and for this i get we need to be there

in the internet of things we need to

put a face of the renewables because

visualizing

performance is excellent visualizing

consumption

is something that we don't used to do

we just live and use our things but we

are not really aware of what we consume

as people living in this building so

using these buildings so

um those are my my my key messages and

um that's it thank you very much thank

you so much mrs orapesa and

now i'd like to go to ann rosenberg and

i believe you'll be talking about

sustainable development

thank you so much yeah absolutely so um

i work for a company called woodplc i

recently joined from

sap so i have a 20 years technology

backgrounds

i couldn't agree more what was already

mentioned by the earlier speakers

that technology play a really key role

uh for

really building a sustainable

infrastructure

um i recently launched uh together with

you in global compact the sdg ambition

and together with antonio general

secretary um

and the sdg ambition is a translation of

the 17 global goals into the private

sector

and when we look at the building sector

uh and across the whole heating

um and opportunity we have to really

build a solid sustainable infrastructure

and there are two ambitions that i want

to to mention here

that we are seeing more and more

companies in the private sector

coming together around this is the one

called 100 percent sustainable material

input

that uh renewable recycling or re

reusable

so what does that mean when you say that

it actually means a lot it actually says

that

from you designing a building to

identifying material

for the building to to to really build

the whole thing around this

actually need to be rethought rethinked

uh just thinking about recycling

we're not just talking about recycling a

portion but recycling everything we are

talking about

the material of the of what you use when

you build the building need to be

rethinked about so we talk about huge

changes

and it can see when we talk about um

a big shift in this sector this is not

the only sector that is being shifting

right now every single industry is being

being shifted

so this is one ambition that i want to

to mention the second ambition

is the ambition around sign based

emission reduction

in the line with 1.5 where you can say

when we build buildings and when we set

up heating systems

that that sector as any other sector

also need to go in joint lead and a

united way to contribute to

uh to to work on making sure we don't

increase more than the 1.5 and

uh and less over time so so

the work that we do at wood with is a

companies with which is in six hour

countries around the world

we really help uh to build up

sustainable infrastructure

and uh what is exciting for me for what

we see right now because a lot needs to

be done

is to see the role of technology at the

role of technology

even though there's a lot of great

technology solutions out there today

uh one thing is to have a great idea and

technology solutions within green

cleantech but we also need to make sure

that we get them

integrated into the way we built the way

we build heating systems

and and some of the excitement that i'm

seeing right now is the whole startup

ecosystem that i also know that berlin

is very known for but we have great

startup ecosystem all over the world

uh on clubhouse there's a lot of

conversation going on right now about

the startup

movement and clean green take in in in

europe concert united states and there's

no doubt about the united states is

accelerating now based on

that u.s is back into the paris

agreement i

and the fact that i'm danish the most

queen's countries in the world and i

live united states

i have this incredible perspective about

what we can do we work together in a

united way

but i think what is very important

because this is not going to be easy

and because we talk about shifting

business model we talk about

shifting in the way we build we talk

about public private partnerships

we talk about that technology will play

a much bigger role that they've ever

been building before and i always think

about

and it was mentioned also before that we

it's not that

building buildings and building smart

see this is a new thing

because we've been working with smart

cities and the concept of smart cities

but i always think about how smart were

we really when we built smart cities

because we left the most important thing

out of it and that was the

sustainability

and not just sustainability but the

resilience and this is what

post covit you can say one thing that co

would have learned

all of us is that you can't build

anything if you don't put resilient into

the conversation

so we need to make sure when we built we

built the new kind of

of of buildings and heating systems and

that we take into consideration the

ambitions that are just mentioned for

your global compact

but we also build it in a way that it is

resilience

because now it with kovit is the health

crisis we have the climate climate issue

but there are many more things that need

to be solved going forward

and and you can say well we really

prepared no we were not prepared

was was was we we thought we were

prepared we thought we thought about

everything

because the smart cities are not a new

concept it's been existing for a number

of years

so i can say on behalf of wood we we see

an exciting time wood has

incredible engineers around energy

transition digital technology

sustainable infrastructure

and um we are going to see a world in

front of us

where a lot of new things need to be

created

but we can only do it if we do it in

united way and that's why i always shout

out you in because i think what u.n is

doing to the world by uniting us

and understanding that one thing is to

build and create solutions

if you live in europe you live in united

states but what if you live

in in in in other part of the world

where building and infrastructures are

very different

so we need to make sure what we do is a

sustainable

approach that can be used all over the

world and that is what i always look at

you in

because that is what the mandate so we

talk about buildback better it was

mentioned before

it's not just building back better in

one society is building back better in

every single society around the world

those are wonderful words thank you so

much ms rosenberg i want to go to the

results

of our audience poll as a reminder that

question was

what challenges must be overcome in your

country in order to and i'll use the

term again

wake the sleeping giant let's take a

look and see what we have

ah we have the biggest one is increased

renovation rate um

women of the panel i'll ask you to

incorporate that idea into the next

question i have

i'd like to address it first to martina

otto and then we can open it up to

everyone

should obligations for renewable energy

sources in heating and cooling apply

in order to to do just this to wake this

giant

ms otto

well um i think i mean one thing to say

is heating and cooling obviously

counts for a huge share of the energy

consumption

um in um in buildings

so that's why uh it is very good and

very important to put a lot of emphasis

on that and obviously there's different

ways how we go about that and i alluded

to that we heard a little bit more

already in terms of well um

well if if it's provided with

electricity um

then look at what is behind it how the

electricity is being

used what are the other alternatives uh

looking at

for example the district heating and

cooling was mentioned as well which is

really good which looks

beyond the single building but um at a

neighborhood

and connected uh solutions um and then

looking beyond that how we build and

actually um

obviously renovation is super critical

in this uh where most of the buildings

are built and here i want to

maybe differentiate a little bit uh and

you got a result that's

maybe um linked to as well um the

where the audience does come from there

are differences and marisol mentioned

that already a little bit

there are differences from one region to

the other from one country to the other

and obviously within countries as well

but what is important to to keep in mind

is we need a dual strategy we need to

improve it's not either or but we need

to renovate

existing buildings with a deep

renovation and i think that's absolutely

critical

and there are a few tools to help us

unlock that so for example just as a

keyword

um building passport that help us keep

track of what goes into a building and

when

critical stages of renovation are being

taken place

are taking place if we turn that into

something that helps create the value or

maintain

the value of buildings then maybe we

have more of an economic story behind

that as well

and the other one really is also what

happens with the new build and

it's not only about the heating and the

cooling but it's also about the

materials i made this case at the

beginning and we heard a bit about

well different alternative building

materials with wood

but if we if you look at off at some of

the numbers if you look to to to africa

for example

um the cement production is expected to

more than triple

um and steel production more than

six-fold

increases so this is huge and that's

obviously not the only region where this

is going to happen so if you don't look

also at the materials

at the same time um and that the new

build we are missing out on an

opportunity

and if we know that and and one one key

point point that you get to this level

is looking at the building codes

um and uh if we know that

only 73 countries in the world do have a

building code

um and if we know as well that

two-thirds of the countries where most

of the new builds will actually happen

then we really have an issue here that

we need to address so

looking at heating and cooling um is

important

but not only from taking the service

side but looking really at how can we

redesign our buildings um to reduce the

demand for heating cooling

in the first place so passive solutions

and so on

is is really critical uh in in in going

forward

and maybe to also look at nature-based

solutions particularly if you if you

look towards uh the cooling side which

is a huge topic that's coming up we've

just heard about

the health impacts with regard to covet

um well the health impacts from

the heat waves are enormous and

we need to actually build the resilience

right now

both in terms of the renovation but also

thank you very much mrs otto you

mentioned renovations and that

leads me to my next question which is

for marisol oro pesa in your experience

with the german heat changers campaign

what incentives do homeowners need to

then make significant improvements in

terms of cost

in the efficiency of their homes or to

switch their heating system to something

with renewable energy

first of all is the lack of awareness

what we need to tackle because people

are not really aware of what they

consume for heat what are the costs many

people think about electricity and when

they

they when you ask them how much you

spend on on gas for instance which is

typical for instance here in mexico

say oh well i don't know i have to think

a little bit so

it's first of all uh raising awareness

and for this is what i mentioned before

the internet of things can help us to

put this

issue in the daily routine of people

how can they visualize it and be

conscious about what they are

using as an energy source and the same

happens for the industry for instance

when you buy a product you think the

product is already organic and has a

very nice package but how was it

produced is something that no really

really cares about the second thing is

uh cost

for me is it's always a cost issue not

only the environmental costs which is

very difficult to to show or to know

or to understand but if we could have a

fair competition

with fossil fuels then renewables would

be much more

competitive and people would make an

informed decision but also a very

conscious decision and it would be

really an option do i want to continue

using fossil fuels or do i want to go

for the green option what other whatever

it is if it's

a solar thermal or if it's hit pumps or

if it's

any other renewable source but as long

as

fossil fuels are still subsidized or

have a more competitive price

economical price not environmental price

people are not going to understand

and solar obligations are a good thing

it has worked in many countries it has

worked in israel for instance for solar

thermal it's one of the countries with

the largest

penetration rate per capita has worked

in countries like

spain and at the city level for instance

also mexico for new belt

it's a must however people always think

of costs and i think it's the most

important issue right now

environmental awareness is raising

things to or things that

we need to say like this thanks to all

these bad things which are happening

with covet or with climate change

however it's still not the main reason

to make a purchase decision

it's always cost cost for investors

costs for

single home owners costs for people

living in a small building how much does

it cost not only investment costs and

long-term costs and as long as fossil

fuels are still being subsidized

supported

the competition is going to be very high

so

that would be my my guess for the

question

thank you very much miss oral pesa uh

and rosenberg i'll have a question for

you but first i have another question

for our audience

get ready to answer another question on

slido do you believe that the topic

of climate neutral buildings has a high

priority in your country when it comes

to climate protection

and we'll check in just before the end

of our panel with your audience

responses

uh for right now we're already getting a

few in no but so why don't we go to ann

rosenberg

um ms rosenberg what are your thoughts

how do we

change people's mindset when it comes to

buildings

um i actually love that you asked that

question because um

i was just thinking about what was set

uh or

just previous uh i think it's all about

education understanding

and about responsibility um

and uh because often we take things

forgiven and and i think it has the same

thing when we turn on the light or when

we

go into a building how much do we

actually think about how

in the material and how this whole thing

has been put together

but what if we begin to think about it

why don't we begin to take

responsibility for

our decision when we when we buy an

apartment or buy a house or

let's get a new rent uh what if we begin

to

just like we we are changing our buying

decision that we decide now

we take responsibility we want to live a

sustainable life i think

i think education and understanding and

i think that's something that cool we

have shown us uh i also think that

uh when you build buildings you know be

accountable responsible

share your data there's a lot of project

going on now that i think is super

exciting across cities where cities go

in

and together with um building owners and

you know

schools and private people and figuring

out what is the

net zero crosstains higher city and you

take a joint responsibility i think if

we all step

up and take a role in this because

that's the only way you can change

things

uh but it comes to one point that is

transparency and education and this is

what data can give us today

but also conversations and and there was

one thing i i want to

what was mentioned before by let's see

that this is about

if you look around renovation and

material

i think this whole thing about

understanding about recycling and reuse

and and and and my concern is when she

mentioned

steel and she mentioned cement because

as we are seeing that

the the way of living is becoming better

all around the world

and i think more things we going to

build and the materials is going to be

used

if we don't begin to change the

understanding about

using cement using steel how you build

how you use healing systems

but if you just come continue to repeat

what we have done for years

we're not going to change things it's

kind of funny thing like

it it's about changing the new normality

we need to create a new normality within

the building sector

what is acceptable when you build a

building and

so we make sure that everything that's

going to be built going forward is going

to build the right way

and and that go back to you asked the

question before about

a i call it the regulations i think it's

time to put in regulation responsibility

and that's again going back to you in

about setting up

strong ambitions and then be accountable

for those ambitions

in a united way so so so i think

education

regulations transparency

and then simple build a new standard for

how you build and use heat

and make sure that that is going to be

adapted all over the world

and not to forget affordable right it

needs to be affordable

so i know we are shifting a huge

industry here

but it can't be at the price that that

the price goes up because then

it will not be possible right so that's

something we need to

take into account and of course it's a

big it's a big ask because

we need to come up with technology

solutions we need to come up with

solutions

that is affordable out of the world but

but but but this is also a learning that

we all are getting right now going

through kovit

if you look at the pharmaceutical

industry uh around getting access to

vaccine getting access equally to that

um

so no it's going to be exciting but but

it's a huge shift but i believe we can

do it

because we need to yeah i like that you

say that i believe we can do it because

we need to

um i want to check in with our audience

poll quickly and then i have a final

thought

uh for ms otto why don't we go ahead and

bring up the results from our slido

do you believe that the topic of climate

neutral building has a high priority in

your country when it comes to climate

protection

63 of you say no 37 percent of you say

yes

i see what's lovely here uh for our

audience at home i have are three

panelists here on the screen in front of

me and it's been such a pleasure to

watch you nod

in agreement and it's been wonderful to

get to see your faces today

um i have a actually uh ms otto i'd like

to ask you the the same question that i

just posed to mrs rosenberg uh before we

close out this panel

how do you change people's mindset when

it comes to buildings

well i think we've heard quite a bit of

that uh already and

well people they have to unpack a little

bit as well um

it's uh who who lives in a building who

owns a building

um and and it's also the all the people

who are

uh working on making buildings um

happen uh so it's not entire workforce

uh

as as well and i think it's what we what

we keep saying is about radical

collaboration across the entire value

chain

so that whatever is proposed it's

already slightly different

um all radically different but that

there is much better cooperation and

coordination between the different

um professions in in the sector

um sometimes solutions are proposed at a

at a two later stage uh to

factor in into the conception and and so

on so

that's that's a key one um if we look at

um materials i think it's important to

what what unsaid in terms of changing

some of the norms

and factoring in culture as well not

everything has been created

um since the dawn of time with fermented

steel it has become the modern way of

doing things like that

um but there is maybe a way uh to think

about

what was good before and modernize that

as well so look at alternative building

materials

in a in a very modern and uh innovative

uh stuff

bring that on board as well it's about

the trend for these final thoughts
