today we'll be looking at the question

of

how can we align industrial development

strategies with decarbonization pathways

in other words how can we green the

industry now

our session today will consist of three

rounds of questions for the panel

and one meantime question for you ladies

and gentlemen who are enjoying

this stream from our virtual platform

round one we'll take a look at

industrial processes and the state of

innovation for around 10 minutes

then we'll discuss current regulatory

frameworks and the role of policymakers

that will be followed by a round of

questions from you our audience so

be sure to take advantage of social

media and of course that chat function

right here in the virtual program so now

to our panel

i'll keep introductions here brief so

that we have as much time as possible to

talk

in this virtual platform for our

speakers time keeping is of the essence

so please be sure to keep your responses

to two minutes or under

joining me today are felipe bayonne

president and ceo

of eco petrol alexandra decker manager

for public affairs germany and central

europe at cemex

chiago bajao president of the brazilian

energy research office epe

marcus rauramo ceo of fordham and felix

zeba the energy and climate policy head

for basf

hello welcome welcome to you all and

thank you so much for joining me

um i think what i'd like to do first is

get us started off with a mental meter

question which you are

our panelists are of course welcome to

answer but also to our audience

listening at home

this is a multiple choice question it is

the following

the level of environmental regulation

currently in place for

industry sectors such as oil and gas

construction

and chemical production is far too low

somewhat too low just right somewhat

too high or far too high we'll take a

look at those results

a little bit later on but for right now

i would like to get into

our round of questions alexandra decker

i'll start with you

followed by felix zebach

is the current rate of ambition and

technological innovation in your

industry sufficient to achieve

net zero industry emissions by 2050 ms

decker

hi ms decker are you with us i'd like to

see if we could answer

uh ask mr ziebach to answer that same

question is the current rate of ambition

and technological innovation in your

industry sufficient to achieve net zero

industry emissions by 2050.

so alexandra please go ahead i see you

okay thank you

thank you i think the rate of ambition

in the cement industry is

high and as well in my my company we

have already

committed uh to reach the worldwide

climate neutrality in 2050 and also

committed to the 55

reduction goal until 2013. you you

no doubt moreover our end product

concrete is an indispensable building

material also to meet global challenges

in terms of technol technological

invasion

innovations the cement industry faces a

great challenge we have already invested

in the avoidance of co2 emissions

by increasing the production efficiency

in very

various ways also the development of

and new products like low clinker cement

or low

low co2 concrete this is an important

component for achieving climate

neutrality

but if carbon emissions cannot be

avoided in any other way

and this is actually the case of

two-thirds of

imagine emissions in the cement

production it's a chemical process

the only solution is carbon capture and

closing

the carbon cycles as far as possible by

using

carbon uh in ideally long life

products so we are talking about ccu

and as no large scale ccu solutions are

currently existing we also have

to to face and to invest in carbon

capture and geological storage

as well so ccs which entails the

construction of an

entire co2 transport infrastructures

so both areas ccs and ccu require

immense technological investment

innovation

and there's um no out of the shelf

solution even

a large scale but we are full of energy

to go this way

and currently a lot of ccu and ccs

projects are running as joint efforts

a company or company by company

thank you very much ms decker and thank

you so much for your patience with our

technological hiccups here

mr zebach i'll address the same question

to you is the current rate of ambition

and technological innovation

in your industry sufficient to achieve

net zero industry emissions by 2050

yeah we're taking this challenge very

seriously and and i guess the level of

ambition is pretty high

so we as bsf has have significantly

ramped up our efforts

uh in reducing emissions over the last

couple of years

um actually we have cut uh our emissions

in half since 1990 why we doubled our

sales outcome already but we realize now

what is behind

us was somewhat easier to achieve

than what is ahead of us so we are now

facing a new

phase of technological and economically

economical challenges when it comes to

emission-free technologies

we need in many ways new

downstream technologies we need to

electrify

processes with renewable energy that we

haven't

electrified in the past so the

low-hanging fruits are pretty much done

we need to tackle this problem and we're

doing this with

significant resources money

people and ideas to address that

issue and yeah maybe

maybe one more thing is that

the critical point is renewable

electricity here so

technologically and just to get it right

technologically we know how to avoid

pretty much every single ton of carbon

in the chemical industry

are technologically technologies

economically feasible are they fully

acceptable in many ways there are some

open questions we are quite optimistic

that we can tackle most of them

but um yeah we we know what the

what the road what the the trajectory is

and we have now to

further uh work on that and we are quite

optimistic that we will

succeed in the end and maybe one last

sentence

cutting emissions further is a essential

and essential

license to operate question for the

chemical industry we do believe that

there is no other way around that

and if we want to get a license to

operate especially in europe but also in

other parts of the world

we need to cut emissions even further

and we are working on that

great thank you so much mr zebach i'd

like to go right to our second question

where we'll take a look at greenhouse

gases in light of the continuously

rising

ghg emissions how can energy companies

especially those engaged in fossil fuel

energy production

do more to be part of the solution and

do less to be part of the problem

let's start with marcus ramo

co2 reductions actually in the last

decade were mostly achieved

uh by the energy sector uh and that was

achieved by

reducing coal fired production

and the massive increase in renewables

now today it's clear that that any

energy company has to have a clear

decarbonization path and in fortum

we are targeting carbon neutrality in

our european operations

by 2035 and cutting our emissions

in half by 2030. so well ahead of eu

target

we have a clear call exit path for the

remaining coal assets

we're exiting uh call in our district

heating in espo already

in 2025 exiting call in the uk 2025

in netherlands by the end of 2029 and 80

of our german qualified production will

be exited

by 2025 but i see actually more

opportunity

than a challenge uh in this area the

sites are

exactly in the in the right places uh to

provide

balancing power storage flexibility

uh with new forms of uh of generation

and for example hydrogen

and this is a good segue to actually

comment that

we focus now a lot on also technologies

to clean other sectors like heating

industry and transport

we can do that with clean gases for

example hydrogen ammonia

and electrification for example of

transport one example of this type of

activity is

is a potential 500 megawatt electrolyzer

project

that we are contemplating at a mass

fluctu site in rotterdam

that could provide three terawatt hours

of uh clean hydrogen

and reduce if used for example for steel

four million tons of co2

in addition to this we are developing uh

solar

and onshore wind 1.5 to 2 gigawatts of

new capacity in europe by 2025

in russia we have a two gigawatt uh

renewable uh

pipeline and then and then of course

solutions for decarbonizing and circular

economy solutions for industries and

infrastructure

for example waste to energy plastic

recycling battery recycling so the

answer is

we can do a lot and we are doing a lot

thank you very much i'd like to address

the same question to felipe bayern how

can your company

be more of the solution and less of the

problem when it comes to ghg emissions

good evening and good morning everyone

thanks for having me here today

and i think the um the companies that

are in the oil and gas industry

are are very well placed in terms of um

providing the technology providing the

resources and the know-how

to ensure that we can all advance in

this matter

and one reflection that i normally make

or or constantly make is that

one co2 ton is the same regardless of

where it's emitted in the world

we're all in the same boat in this one

but it does matter where we actually

invest the resources and in that sense

from echo patrol

there's a few things that i can mention

we're doing one

we're becoming a gassier company we're

producing more and more

gas uh roughly 80 percent of colombians

use um

gas today every day but we they're still

one and a half million families that use

coal and wood to cook on a daily basis

so we need to advance in that sense

and as marcus was mentioning couple

things we're doing

we're looking at a small electrolyzer in

our research facility this year

we're actually focused on energy

intensity energy emissions

and reducing our footprint not just co2

footprint

but also the water footprint and it has

to do with our circular

economy we're looking at things like

nature-based

solutions and by 2030 colombia

has pledged to reduce 51

of its co2 emissions so we're going to

be

announcing this year our goal by 2030

and 2050

we are working on a different goal but

now the bar has been raised

and in that sense by 2030 we want to

have

50 that's five zero eco reserves that's

forest reserves

so we're looking at nature-based

solutions as well so i do believe

that the industry oil and gas which has

been fundamental for countries like

colombia

and that we need to protect at its core

to ensure that we do an

orderly transition whilst we bring our

resources technology know-how

to ensure that we can reach the goal

that we are all aiming for

thank you very much mr baion our last

question in this first round is for

thiago bajal welcome back it's happy to

see your face again

um uh my question to you is how can

industry leaders

be a little bit more proactive in

driving technological innovation and the

systemic shift

to a green economy in their respective

sectors mr bagal

thank you jennifer i'm really glad to be

at betd

now for the third time um well speaking

from an energy planning perspective

industrial assets have typically long

lifespan

and we are talking about investments

that will be around

for many years sometimes decades and

because of this

we are we realize that any successful

approach

towards screening the industry will need

to combine on one

hand incremental innovation and on the

other hand

radical innovation incremental

innovation uh they can be pretty

relevant for reducing carbon footprint

of the existing assets during their

remaining lifespan

and in addition to that it will increase

efficiency and

as a result competitiveness they are not

so costly they have a shorter payback

period

so they are more easily implemented and

will help us better manage

our carbon budget while we develop and

deploy

radical innovation so just to give one

example

the digital transformation of industrial

processes

will certainly untap a great number of

incremental innovations

but of course incremental innovation

alone

will not lead us to systemic shift that

we need

so radical innovation then will need to

be deployed

with new uh when new industrial plants

when new industrial facilities are

designed and built

and this will only likely to happen once

these innovations are proven at least on

a demonstration scale

so if we want industry leaders to be

more proactive

we better work to disseminate and reduce

a symmetry of information about best

practices

available technologies and r d projects

regarding

each industrial uh process reducing

transaction costs

towards decapitization we better work to

redisseminate and

the adoption of information systems and

the

digitalization of the various industrial

processes and sectors

we better work to facilitate access to

finance and off-balance resources for

innovation investment

and last but not least be sure to remove

as fast as possible any regulatory

barriers that may

arise in the pathway thank you very much

mr barrel thank you all for your opening

statements

um i'd like now to take a moment and go

to our mentimator results as a reminder

the question was the level of

environmental regulation

currently in place for industry sectors

such as oil and gas

construction and chemical production is

and it looks like most of us have said

far too low we need more for

far-reaching government control and

oversight

somewhat too low we're looking right

around 90

of people saying 80 of people saying

somewhat too low or far too low

thank you everyone for participating in

that poll i'd like to go now

for round two with our panelists

the current regulatory framework and the

role of policymakers

again in this round we'll ask our

speakers to keep their replies to around

two minutes

our first question is for three of you

for mr zebach

ms decker and mr bayonne what can

policymakers do

to better support your industry in

transitioning to cleaner technologies

and production processes why don't we

start with mr zebach

well as i said in my first statement so

the key to

bsf's transition towards climate

neutrality

is renewable energies and renewable

electricity

in particular so the the main priority

for policymakers around the world should

be

abolish any potential barrier

roadblock or hurdles on renewable

energies right

that may be taxes there may be levees

that may be surcharges

that make renewable energy more

expensive

than it has to be that may be

infrastructure

bottlenecks that may be slow

permitting processes for renewable

energy infrastructure

we in bsf we believe that it takes both

it takes on the one hand

own renewable electricity generation

in the chemical industry and it needs to

and it needs a procurement strategy

from the market off the grid

so both pillars have a strong regulatory

angle and we can only encourage policy

makers to address that issue and one

more thing

downstream we are facing significant

economic gaps of new technologies

towards

state-of-the-art technologies for the

time being we believe

we need an appropriate funding framework

to bridge that gap

not forever right not for decades but

to ramp it up to start deploying these

technologies

funding needs to be considered

and for example in europe there's a

strong

framework given by the european

union for state aid and things like that

we

we think we strongly believe that all of

it needs to be

reconsidered in the in the context of

that transition challenge we are facing

thank you very much mr zebach ms dekker

the same question to you

thank you um we we need a reliable

policy

framework and i mentioned earlier ccs

and ccu

um the cement industry and samix we need

investment programs and

governmental support and i absolutely

agree with mr

zibach we need the implant we need um

we need uh the implementation of

um green energy of of renewable energy

we need more capacity

and and the availability of renewable

energy i can not say it

enough and the further development of

political uh instruments to secure the

gap between co2 price and respective co2

abatement costs

as an example the widespread

introduction of

carbon contracts for difference whatever

those

contracts are looking like in detail

but we need them and those programs will

enable the

commercial scaling up and commissioning

of new technologies

on a supranational level we needed first

european white but also on the long term

worldwide

um co2 emission driven trading systems

uh to continue and to be to improved

today this is the ets for for europe

which works quite well from our

perspective

will soon enter into a carbon border

adjustment tax

at eu level to protect the industry from

carbon leakage and carbon leakage is a

is a as a real danger for the for the

industry so we need those

um instruments but we should also not

forget the power of the market

um and the demand for climate neutral

that's

what we currently see the demand for

climate neutral product is currently not

sufficient

to make large those large scale

investments

in the climate neutral production so for

example what we need from the policy

sustainable public procurement as a pr

role model or

financial incentives or adaptation of

regulations

so what we need is um foremost reliable

uh political framework thank you very

much ms decker

i'd like to address the same question

now to mr baion

well i i think the um the colombian

example has been a very good one

in in what sense over the last two and a

half years

colombia has gone from basically no

renewable energy

to commitments to of 2500 megawatts

today

in our case eco petrol we're the largest

self-generating company in colombia

and we've already started

constructing our solar farms and we're

already measuring winds in many parts of

the country

and and please bear in mind that

colombia is in that sense is very

blessed

in terms of uh solar power or ability

for solar power

and wind capacity so we're gonna go from

basically none

or zero to 400 megawatts of solar and

wind by 2023

and we're aiming at at least uh one

gigawatt in that sense

so i think regulation is already in

place and it's clarity around

the framework that companies can use and

investors can use

and in terms of the incentives that have

been mentioned by my colleagues already

by government the second thing and

that's that's to do with renewables the

second thing is around

hydrogen and with the help of the

german government colombia is building

its hydrogen pathway and following

examples that have been successful like

chile for example

and we're working in that sense and i

was mentioning the electrolyzer that

we're bringing later

this year into the country around

nature-based solutions there's clarity

around some of the usages that we can do

in colombia and i think colombia is very

well placed

the last thing i mentioned i will

mention is that

in eco petrol we have actually made a

non-binding

offer for isa which is one of the

largest

energy transmission companies in the

region so that in that sense just moving

from

pure oil and gas protecting oil and gas

but expanding into other areas

that are actually allowable or allowed

by regulation

is a good sign and just thinking about

the companies that we need to be

in the next 10 20 30 years

thank you very much i've got another

question for our

two panelists mr barao and mr rauramo

how can environmental regulation of

industries be coordinated

more effectively on an international or

on a multilateral level

uh let's go ahead and start with mr

baral

okay well jennifer i would start by

saying that

finance plays a central role here if

money owners

set their lending policies based on

certain environmental

regulation standards this will certainly

have an impact a positive

impact this combined with a strong

capacity

building all across the industry

regulation regulators

policy makers particularly in emerging

economies

that can help the world avoid either

carbon leakage

when you have migration of industries to

regions

with less stringent environmental

regulations

but also avoid developed countries

closing their markets for industrial

imports based on

environmental claims in addition to that

i i'd like to mention also the

importance of a few a few issues

first disseminating information about

the state of the art

in terms of environmental regulation

it's really important

and for sure this can be uh accelerated

by means of technical cooperation

between countries on an on a

multilateral

uh uh arena also

developing uh regulation that is based

on comprehensive criteria regarding

carbon emissions

instead of picking technology specific

end-of-pipe solutions or

regulations that end up causing

technology locking

and that at the end may be too costly or

delay adoption of radical innovations

also i would like to mention the

positive impact of

announcing regulation with progressive

steps

with a medium and long-term perspective

that can

also set the pace and help mobilize

more people more businesses and more

governments

as well as providing stronger incentive

for

r d and innovation to be developed and

finally if i may still add

carbon border adjustment if fairly

designed

and comprehensive enough i would say it

can also help promote international

coordination for greening the industry

thank you very much mr baral i'll

address the same question to mr audamo

now

thank you jennifer i'll i'll pick up on

a couple of points actually that the

fellow

fellow fellow panelists felipe and

alexandra

raised so philippe said that uh that

this is a global issue and

indeed climate change is a global issue

and then alexandra's point that

we will need huge amounts of uh

renewables

and then uh policy policies uh

play policies and regulations play a

huge role

so climate change doesn't stop at

national borders that is clear

and that's why we we do need a global

approach and

global coordination to fight it uh also

ambition level is important

and uh the european green deal

which is designed to mobilize 1 trillion

euros of sustainable investments is a

very good start

a lot of coordination is needed because

the markets will become

more and more interdependent and complex

also electricity and gas which from our

point of view are

two key businesses they will become more

and more

interconnected so on the point about

the huge need of renewables needed i'll

take europe as an example

areas which which need it for example

germany to clean up both the electricity

and gases

now germany is producing about 45

percent of the electricity and 18

of total energy by renewables so much

more is needed

but there will not be enough land there

will not not be

locations or zoning possible to do that

in europe however there are areas like

the nordics which have

potential for hundreds of terawatt hours

of renewables electricity production

so we need a holistic approach to make

sure that that energy flows

whether it's electricity or gases they

flow from the places where they can be

produced to the

places where they will be consumed so we

need a

holistic regulatory approach both

european

and uh and then uh cross-continental

same applies for green hydrogen many of

fellow panelists mentioned actually

hydrogen and uh and ideally we would

have

as global and as transparent markets as

possible

to make sure that that when someone is

producing let's say if we produce

uh clean hydrogen in finland that would

be regarded

clean in europe that would be regarded

clean in brazil and clean in colombia

and

vice versa then we'll have efficient

allocation of capital

and resources

a successful example of this is carbon

pricing

in in the sectors where ets has been

applied in europe

but what we would need to see going

forward really to fight climate change

is that uh

that ets would be further tightened it

would be brought into other sectors and

eventually we would have

uh global ideally global carbon pricing

that would that would then

uh mean that that we wouldn't have to

for example have

uh carbon border taxing uh

to avoid carbon carbon leakage so

unified carbon pricing

across the sectors sector coupling and

sector coupling

i think is the uh is the last point i

wanted to mention here so

to achieve our climate targets both the

uh the clean cleaning of electricity and

cleaning of gases

it will be really really essential that

we have a regulation

that enables all the required amount of

renewables to come to market

and then to connect that to the

flexibility and storage possibility

of clean gas but vital and very

important for us so we are definitely

supporting supporting

cross-national and cross-continental

policies and regulation and target

setting

thank you so very much mr arama thank

you to all five of our panelists for

this engaging discussion we talked about

carbon pricing

making it united we talked about more

capacity for renewable energy

uh we talked a little bit about green

hydrogen we talked about how finance is

key and that

perhaps most importantly climate change

doesn't stop at borders
