hi

i'm gina demonic i'm the managing

partner of emerald technology ventures

and glad to be invited here and we're

going to be having a panel discussion

today

about financing energy innovation

and i've got some great panelists here

i'd like to quickly introduce them

then afterwards i'm going to hand them

over to tell us a little bit more about

what their companies do so my first

panelist is damian

he's the founder of rethinks it's a

not-for-profit think tank

that has developed a framework to better

understand the non-linear nature

of technology disruption across the

economy and its broad implications on

society

we also have max bach from he's a

managing

investment manager at high tech

lindefold he's

been supporting over 60 startups and he

focuses on nano and quantum technology

materials and environmental research as

well as industry 4.0 and the future of

work

and our third panelist is

he's leads shell ventures and they're

focused on renewable power and heat

climate tech digital and mobility shell

is obviously one of the most active

investors in the space

and they currently have over 90 active

portfolio companies

so with that short introduction i'd like

each of you to tell us just a little bit

more about what your companies do and if

you wouldn't mind jamie can you start

i certainly can thank you very much

indeed so so i'm jamie arbib i'm

co-founder of rethinkx

we're an independent not-for-profit

research group

and and we we look at technology

disruptions um and we've built a complex

systems framework

uh through which to under to understand

and analyze

um technology disruptions and we tend to

get a very

different outcome from our from our

research and analysis from from a lot of

the mainstream forecasters

that you'll see um and so we recently

published a report on

on on the electric power sector and and

and we see some extraordinary outcomes

as

as we transition over the course of the

2020s so first of all

you know what we see is is just the

extraordinary cost improvements so

solar wind and batteries you know

dropping very quickly and we're at the

point now where where solar and wind are

the lowest cost forms of generation in

large parts of the world

and we're not far away from the point

where

solar wind becomes cheaper than just the

marginal cost of conventional energy

generation

and this is profound because we've we've

seen a disruption to the new build

power market we're about to see a

displacement of existing

energy assets and we're also seeing

batteries begin to compete in the

peaking market they can offer lower cost

peaking resource which which is

disrupting that part of the market

but it is a cost improvements and

continue by the 2030s

we expect a 100 percent renewable

solar wind and battery system um to be

the lowest cost

form of energy generation that we can

have and what's interesting is that when

you build out that model you get a

completely

different architecture to your energy

system so you build or we think you'll

build that system

uh you know through the late 2020s by

building a massive oversupply of solar

and wind

to minimize um to to minimize battery

cost so that you can meet demand

on the darkest day of the darkest year

and what's interesting about that system

is

you know you build this low-cost system

and you get a super abundance of energy

on pretty much every other day of the

year

as an outcome of that so you'll have

what we call superpower which is is

is this essentially zero cost um energy

and we think that'll transform the

economy it'll transform far more than

than energy variation almost any demand

that becomes shiftable

will shift to take advantage of that low

cost so it will have impacts on for

instance steel production

cement production we'll be able to

produce hydrogen for instance

based on that low cost energy production

uh we'll be able to desalinate water

electrify

transport maybe electrified you know the

heat uh heating and buildings and all

kinds of other things

so so in our analysis you know we see

this as a disruption that's driven by

the economics we don't need new

technology we've got everything we need

um so the challenge is really in terms

of financing the scale up

and also the challenges and how the rest

of the economy

adapts to what is a fundamentally

different disruption we think that most

of the mainstream analysis

tends to look at disruption as a sort of

one for one substitution that we're

going to build a solar plant to replace

a gas plant or a coal plant it's not

like that disruption doesn't work like

that it's a phase change

it's a change in system state i think

i'll leave it there

okay thanks ever going to come back to

that that point

in just a minute here max can you tell

us a little bit more about high tech

grinder phone because that would be

interesting i think for

our audience to understand uh why it

started and how it's structured

absolutely i mean jamie gave a wonderful

introduction already in the field and

the future outlook and

i couldn't rely more on that uh

high-tech wonderful

started off as a public and today still

is a public private fund

meaning that the german government took

upon itself to help

fuel this innovation in uh many

different aspects

upon one of which the electricity and

the

essentially also the energy vendor as we

know it in germany

we are uh on the private side backed by

35 of the largest german companies in

the space including

energy companies like avia ave statewide

and a number of others which

show also the huge interest in the

market

to not only um back innovative startups

at this very early phase in order to

build out also the european model of

innovation in this space

but also to for large companies to

observe and learn also from these

younger companies and then have a

natural

integration point later on so a lot of

our investors

in our fund basically use this as an

opportunity to enter later phases of the

business which gives us a tremendous

leverage for those startup teams joining

early to have a long-term future

um happy to share more also about my

portfolio in the question time but i'll

leave it now

to the next panelists to introduce

themselves all right thanks kat

thanks um gina um my name is kate van

der waal

um i'm heading up shell ventures we are

global corporate venture capital

player in the renewable energy and the

future mobility space

um with presence in seven locations in

the world from which we

uh source uh investment opportunities

for shell really with the view to

to to get access to new technologies new

ideas new business models that can help

us build

the renewable energy uh and the mobility

business that that we are building

shell is of course already a major

player in mobility but we we're trying

to transform

into more of a service oriented

provider from from a product oriented

provider and we've made

strong commitments as a company towards

decarbonizing not only ourselves but

also our customers

through a sectoral approach and startups

for us play an important role to

actually bring

new technologies and business models

into the company

and help us you know develop new

business models inside shell help us

grow new propositions to our end

customers

and and so we actually do put and i

think it's a major responsibility that

we have as a corporate investor

a lot of effort on helping our our

portfolio companies grow

and and find revenue generating

opportunities inside shell but also

outside shell

and and for that we have a group in my

team that is

focused on implementation management so

they will basically broker connections

between

the the companies we invested in uh or

the companies we are going to invest in

and and and and the various shell asset

managers and projects and

and business managers making sure that

we help grow and develop companies

super thanks a lot that's helpful uh max

maybe i can start with you and

one of the the topics of our panel is

also

talk about this public private um

acceleration of technology innovation in

our

uh in our sector in the energy sector

could you talk a little bit about you

know there's so many different

government models right across the world

governments are obviously very

interested

in um supporting innovation and

entrepreneurship

and and has been particularly successful

in um accelerating the technology

innovation and

in the energy sector can you explain uh

to our audience just

you know kind of a couple of ideas why

is that so why have you guys actually

been able to

to crack the nut when some others have

stumbled

thank you very good question um we

started

uh essentially also fund with the

principal

saying this is not a grant or

another grant scheme for starters but

something that has a market validation

to it

our companies that we accelerate or

actually i shouldn't say accelerate but

truly invest in uh have an evaluation

uh they've been scrutinized the due

diligence process has gone through the

technology has been taken apart

hegf is a seed investor and the largest

one of the largest in europe

and we pride ourselves at including

myself we have a

technical background so we can really

deep dive on these technological terms

prior to any financial revenues being in

the field

and being able to join to flesh out the

future and what we do is we

we give that confidence to private

investors

later on down the line to see the

potential of these startups that

basically would be eligible for grants

but then struggle to find that initial

financing

and it's this gap in the market that

hcgf has been addressing over the last

15 years

and is continuing to do so because we

see that

um even with more investors entering the

seed phase

their number of sectors especially when

they become more risky more renewable

orientated

that it becomes very interesting the

question so how to help those teams at

these early phases

and really gain that traction the market

so our model is very much

aligned with the uh private industry

despite being a public private fund

and not so much a ground giving scheme

nonetheless

thanks to the government's support we

have that volume uh we have funds

with uh 40 investment managers actually

has the capacity to look at a huge range

of

startups emerging from germany but also

surrounding areas

across europe and take the time to deep

dive into the technology and

really uh drive innovation in this

energy sector

that could come from all the things we

have a number of startups in our

portfolio

for instance let's look at optimizing

wind

energy what if climate situations change

house icing treated

for instance another one that is fueling

the

hybridization of grid level energy

by bringing together battery storage and

solar panels and making them a today

already

an economic model it's these things that

i think

played a huge role in the market and

we're so

um i don't know excited to be uh one of

the players here to enable

and feel this um innovation

and so just maybe a follow-up question

on that so does the government

actually get involved in defining the

sectors that you're to focus on

actually in that space we have uh

almost the opposite of a definition we

have the definition

not to exclude certain sectors

and be very broadly based naturally

however

you you probably know this from the vc

market there's certain

fields that are today on vogue or

at least at the beginning of their phase

and other things that have already

passed

there are few examples like bitcoins and

other things where

the the actual bonanza time for

investments has already passed that

phase

i would say um in the sonar panel space

for instance a number of battles have

already been fought

and carried out so now it's the question

what are what is next

what are the new battles outlined and

that's really exciting to see

what kind of innovations are fueling and

driving uh

not only the german economy but but also

europe as such

in that space super no thanks thanks for

that

um jamie you talked to you know about

this massive energy transition

and and max and hans and i are of course

in the business of going out and backing

hopefully the winners but there aren't

only winners

in this transition there's obviously the

the incumbents who might be settled with

with uh legacy assets and whatnot can

you discuss

you know what are some of these

challenges that the incumbents have

and what do you think the role of

government is

in that part of the transition not in

just the supporting the

the seed financing of startups but of

also

helping the incumbents transition yeah

i mean that's a really important

question so i mean

you know we study technology disruptions

and and and there's a very

poor track record of of of uh you know

incumbent businesses being able to adapt

to disruptions once they get underway i

mean you tend to get you know

obviously the virtuous cycle that drives

the adoption of new technology you get

you know increasing economies of scale

decreasing costs more investment more

government support

kind of reinforcing each other and

driving a a

a technology destruction along that

s-curve but there's a

you know a kind of inverse of that a

mirror image of that that happens for

the

for the incumbents which is a death

spiral you have reversing economies of

scale

increasing costs you know less

investment less support and so on and so

forth that that leads them to break down

very quickly and

the the collapse of incumbent industries

can actually happen really quickly

there's you know obviously

you know both operating leverage and

financial leverage that can play a role

in that

and and you know so when we look at the

power market what we see happening

um to conventional power assets is it is

a drop in

in capacity factor in the utilization

rate and

we think that's a very significant

factor that's completely admitted

by by mainstream analysis in fact you

know almost all of the

the the analysis you'll see from

governments or the big ngos that cover

this kind of stuff

assumes a capacity factor is a constant

you know their model in terms of

levelized cost of energy they model an

85 percent capacity factor

um for for most conventional assets you

know add in for an item

into the future but what we're seeing is

is is a solar and winder are

playing an increasing role in the market

we're seeing that drop

and we're seeing it drop substantially

and you'll see the ia forecast that

just you know every year they they they

they you know for instance for

for for coal energy they'll

they'll you know lift the lift the

forecast up and see a bounce back it's

not coming it's going

and and the capacity factor is going to

continue to drop

and what that means is actually for any

new conventional power plant built today

the cost is far more than we think so

the cost of coal

because because what you're doing when

you're calculating the level is you're

taking

all the costs involved over the lifetime

of the plant and dividing it by how much

energy it produces

if that amount of the energy is far less

than is anticipated

then the cost is far more and so there's

absolutely no reason to build a new

conventional power plant anywhere in the

world today already uh we're just making

a mistake that stops us from realizing

that

um so so you know we think that

there's this inevitable disruption

driven by the economics underway and

and actually one of the challenges how

is how we navigate that because

you know what we'll see as capacity

factors drop that you know conventional

power become like peaking power

you know it'll only be used part of the

time but they won't be able to charge

peaking prices um because batteries will

come in and cap that

that they'll provide a ceiling to how

much you can you can so so

we we see essentially a widespread

destruction of value and actually we

want to keep these plants operating to

keep the lights on as we go through this

transition

we're going to need to think about

subsidizing conventional power plants

uh to enable the transition to happen so

that's one role for government is to

understand how quickly that

might happen and the sort of

interventions they'll need to keep our

our grid system stable but more than

that there are social aspects

right as industries get destroyed we

tend not to see these disruptions we

stumble into them and clean up the mess

retrospectively

uh you know communities and jobs

destroyed and

and and and and the social aspects are

are you know incredibly important and

and and and

you know our our view of this is we you

know should adopt a doctor principal of

of

essentially protecting people and not

businesses or assets we don't want to be

propping up

um you know businesses that make no

economic sense but we certainly need

to be protecting the people and and

protecting those assets that we need

into the future but certainly not all of

them so yeah there's a lot of work to do

but you know it kind of starts with with

opening our eyes to what's really

happening and understanding

how quickly and how powerful this can

happen and how profound the consequences

of this change are

i agree i mean super interesting i think

that that obviously the role of

government

to ensure employment retraining of

people is paramount in you know so

you don't have kind of a backlash from

society because of

of uh unemployment in certain sectors

which

we see in certain geographies of the

world

but maybe to go on to head the so we

talked about

you know the this pressure that's being

put on the incumbents

um a bit about how government can play a

role but

but you are uh one of the large

incumbents right

so what do you think um the incumbent's

role

is in kind of developing these

technologies and making sure these

technologies get

deployed even when it may be kind of

seen as a threat

to their um to the legacy business

yes well first of all let's take away

myth that somehow this is a threat to

our legacy business i mean

uh royal dutch shell as a whole is is

only three percent of the energy mix

right so we cannot

let's not have the pretension we can

influence the speed of innovation

in the energy space uh so we need to

embrace it and and so our ability

actually to to source and scale

innovations faster and more efficient

than our competitors and

enforce strategic relationships and

partnerships with third-party innovators

uh to achieve that becomes actually a

significant competitive advantage to

shell in the energy transition so if you

want to

lead in the energy transition then just

focusing on corporate r

d to rely on on on innovation is is not

going to be enough and we realize that

but there's a couple of challenges and

opportunities that come with it i mean

the good news is

there's a lot of money currently being

put in

in startups and scale ups in the energy

domain uh

you know we estimate roughly between 30

and 45 billion a year

of relevance to shell investments are

happening in the vc domain and

what we see also is that sectors are

coming together

the tech sector is collaborating with

with the energy sector to

to basically decarbonize the supply of

electricity to their their

data center the tech sector supplies

web services to the company like shell

we both large suppliers and customers of

each other

and we also both looking at nature-based

solutions and

and agriculture as a way to on the on

the shorter medium term

uh help help decarbonize the the value

chain

and so you actually see agriculture

energy and tech

coming together around the same theme so

i think there's an opportunity really

for collaboration

between large corporates and sectors to

try and achieve the same objective

now the challenges i see is is is one is

supply chain makeup i see that

you know the energy industry still uses

an incumbent supply chain that doesn't

innovate necessarily always at the speed

that we need to meet the challenges of

tomorrow right

i mean this supply chain is is deeply

embedded in whether it's in offshore oil

and gas or offshore wind

and and they they don't necessarily make

the margins to afford r d

or no are not necessarily incentivized

to actually innovate and bring new

technologies and business models to the

field so that's really

a challenge of inertia that that that we

will be facing as a company i think

the the second challenge for us is is

the availability of

of funding for repeat projects right and

and especially the first of a kind

project is hard to fund

but how can we then once we've we've

built let's say one bio lng

facility in the netherlands how can we

replicate that technology

you know 20 50 times across europe

to to liquefy

from renewable sources to to a

transportation fuel

and and so how can we how can we

collectively not only as

as a corporate but also with the

financing sector make funding available

for repeat projects

and i guess the the the the the third

challenge is is internal culture of

course big corporates people sometimes

have the

have the tendency of not invading here

and not not innovated here not

invented here so that's that's something

you need to overcome by actively

uh i think brokering and and connecting

the dots between the startups and the

portfolio companies we invested in and

the asset managers and and the people

working in the business

and but also help the startups and

the portfolio companies understand that

you know their solution typically is a

small part of a much bigger integrated

solution

and so they need to really apply some

some systems thinking

into uh into their organization and and

look at how does

our solution fit into the bigger picture

and how do we make the implementation

uh more uh more flawless so these are

some of the challenges

that that that we're facing now i think

as shell we have a responsibility

towards our portfolio companies to

really

you know help them overcome those kind

of challenges whether it's finding

funding for repeat projects or or

helping them

think about systems integration when

they try to implement something

within shell et cetera et cetera but

it's really you know

broker the connection and the efficiency

in the interface between

between the portfolio companies and

shell where where we can add value

okay yeah i think that the point that

you brought up about collaboration i

think is really important right there

there are these different players you

mentioned also the the finance industry

but max talked about you know kind of

one model of government's role

in um in kind of accelerating the seed

financing part

but i'd like to open it up to you know

to to you guys to give some uh

ideas or or um share with us some

models that you've seen of this collect

where this collaboration is actually

working and where you think it's not

working where you think uh come either

the private sector or the public sector

needs to come to the table

yeah if i may ginon sorry i've been

talking a bit so i'll keep it short but

i think there's two main challenges

there two missing links

uh and uh kunderfund is really good at

it but you know i see a lot of vcs

pulling away from early stage investing

and i i disagree with one of my panel

members that we have all the

technologies we need for the energy and

transition i think there's still a lot

of early stage stuff that we actually do

need to nurture and

and grow to scale in order to actually

you know become

uh uh to to to thrive for carbon

neutrality

now that's one missing link i think is

is early stage

investing um and and secondly i think

you know

what i often see i call it the valley of

death for for these startups is

is is you know startup has developed the

technology has done a few small scale

pilots and now it's time to build a

large-scale facility and and suddenly

we need 50 to 100 million dollars to

invest in a

in a commercial scale plant and the vcs

have stepped out because you know they

need to raise a new fund and they need

to

to to force an exit it's still too early

too much tech risk for

for the pes and for for the

institutional investors and

the only folk around are are the

corporates and

um and that actually is a real hurdle

that we collectively i think as a sector

need to try and overcome

because you know once we we we now have

a couple of these technologies that are

really promising but how do we actually

scale them to size and and scaling is

really important in the energy sector

you know one or two plants is

not enough you know the replication

piece is really important and

i think that's where you know we need to

come together with

a variety of players including

governments to to make those those first

of a kind plans happen

exactly jp or max

um jamie uh if you want you you can go

first otherwise

happy to jump in here

okay i'll go first um

absolutely right and i i think gets

points uh both of his points are true

that

um it's surprising uh

how much innovations freedom is actually

still

out there and needs to be still shaped

taken and formed in a way by

future teams by innovative groups and

projects

in order for us to be um truly

getting closer to our goals that are

very ambitious for the next 20 to 30

years

and i would say even so ambitious that

uh if we just follow road maps that are

existing today we would never reach them

so we need breakthrough technologies

even today still

in in lots of different aspects that's

why

having this heterogeneous approach of

not relying on one or two sector planes

but

really everyone in society to engage in

this

field is really important the second

point is and i also agree with get on

that one

that phase between or i wouldn't call it

the value of death because the value of

death is usually where

we meet the teams for the first time

yeah yeah yeah

essentially uh grant or something and

then no investment

we need to we need a new word

brown fields appropriate yeah exactly

um it's absolutely right and

it was actually addressed internally

with us as well and we've been looking

into the earth

setup which we call the deep tech

futures fund

which takes these businesses at this

scale-up phase

where 50 million is an order of

magnitude that is actually necessary in

order to

get go the next level and really build

out the future teams

and it's um partners like shel

and others who enable this future and

again i believe it's this mixed

breed between public and private that

can really drive forward this future and

i'm starting to see an understanding not

only from the german government side but

also other governments around us

for this appreciation that there's also

a capital need in that space

yeah prior to that it was just you know

seed stage how do we get to that

first valley of death now it's just

understanding what happens next why do

they still get stuck

and it's also i mean outside the energy

sector really important for the future

of

europe to be competitive if we look at

the us or asia

i'm far behind in terms of innovation

and other spaces

next we only have two minutes left so i

want to hand over to to jamie and

get some insight from him he's the one

who's supposed to bring this all

together

the systems thinker well i mean this is

this is this is not my area of expertise

but

i do think there's a mindset challenge

here i mean i think that's

you know kind of central here because

you know the engineers mindset the kind

of the old industrial mindset says

we've got a problem and and and we need

to find a replacement

for all these things to make things

better

but actually you know the world the

world is changing so fundamentally

that everything's kind of bleeding into

each other so you know transport and

and energy and electric power emerging

you know as is as is agriculture and

food and materials and healthcare

actually

and and and so the solution to you know

problems

i mean you know we often think about you

know we've written about the disruption

of the transportation sector

uh and about the technologies that might

disrupt it but i actually think the

bigger disruption to transportation

comes from outside of transportation it

comes from the

it comes from a disruption to the need

for transport but you know we're seeing

that

the all the things we go we we travel

for we might not need to do

but more than that actually i have a new

production model where we don't just

have

huge flows of physical goods through the

the system you know we have a much more

distributed kind of manufacturing

system we don't transport huge

quantities of raw material to

power our system and we don't um and

and we make and manufacture everything

locally based on stuff that's available

locally so

you know it it's getting our heads

around that kind of you know that

systems approach and understanding the

kind of cascading consequences of change

elsewhere and and we need an ecosystem

approach you know we want to get these

businesses funded we need you know

academia we need policy we need

consumers we need business we need all

parts to kind of come together in a much

more

integrated fashion finance can't sit on

its own as one piece of that
