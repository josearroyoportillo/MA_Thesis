I think we have to act because it is not

about technological feasibility anymore

we already have all the solution that we

need to fight the climate crisis

technologies like blockchain like

machine learning artificial intelligence

but also the omnipresent computers and

sensors in every system there are big

big changes taking place in the global

energy system Australia's got one in

five households who have solar power new

roofs and increasing number of those

also installing batteries and they're

also installing smart technology so they

can trade energy with their neighbors

it's does sound a little bit utopian but

I think one of the potential things that

could happen through the energy

transition is that we actually see a

shift to a much more democratic and a

much more equal society growth within

countries and between countries a

[Music]

low-carbon future is only possible if we

transition to a low-carbon energy future

those two are clearly linked the

exciting part is that the low-carbon

energy future is here today and it is

profitable it is commercially viable so

accelerating our path towards a

sustainable future it's also the path

towards a profitable and secure energy

future we need to reforest parts of our

planet we need to stop the destruction

of nature in parts of our planet and we

all need to work together to change our

diet and change our lifestyle in order

for us to live on the planet for the

future

I think structural change has happened

throughout history just think about the

time when horse carriages were replaced

by cars thinking of collective processes

I think it is important not only to take

into consideration ideas like

infrastructure investment or big

business but also think about culture

identity in the region's civil society

and people's engagement because what we

want to create a livable likable and

lively regions if you just always a

chance be bold

let's face it

[Music]
