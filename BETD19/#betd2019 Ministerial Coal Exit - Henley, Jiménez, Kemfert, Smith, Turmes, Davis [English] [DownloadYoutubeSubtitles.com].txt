What are the economic implications of regional
exit coal strategies?

For a long time, coal has powered and heated
millions of households in industrialized countries.

And played an important role in the development
of emerging economies.

However, coal is the world's biggest source
of carbon emissions.

Many states and cities have decided to exit
coal in order to improve their carbon footprint

and air quality.

A coal exit has many socioeconomic implications.

Especially for the regions that have coal
mines.

We need to provide solutions for regions and
individuals that are most affected by the

coal exit.

At this time, this structural change opens
up opportunities.

Now, without further ado I'm going to start
by introducing my panel.

I'm Linda Davis.

I'm pleased to moderate this session.

We have with us professor of economics and
sustain ability the Hertie School of governance

and the head of transport at the German Institute
of economic research.

We have Professor Claudia Kemfert.

Also, on our panel we have mixing the cards
here.

We have minister for energy, Chile, Miss Susana
Jimenez.

We have the parliamentary secretary of state
department of business energy and industrial

strategy of the United Kingdom, Lord Oliver
Henley, glad to have you with us.

And the international trade union confederation,
Samantha Smith, thank you very much for joining us

And sitting on my extreme left is minister
for energy and spatial planning Luxembourg,

Claude Turmes.

We have an excellent and small panel.

We'll be able to dig deeper into some of these
ideas on how we manage the coal exit.

So, set us off, I would like to have Professor
Kemfert take the stage and give us some opening

remarks.

Thank you very much for this very nice introduction.

Thank you for having me here.

I'm really pleased to talk about some aspects
related to the German coal transition or coal

exit.

We did some studies around this.

And this is why I have brought some slides
with me which I would like briefly to present.

This is a joint work with together with
a technical university.

Some colleagues are here.

So, today we have 15 years of research related
to this.

And I'm just presenting a few aspects that
are related to the coal exit and to the coal

phase out.

Especially in Germany.

But before I dive into the German segment,
I wanted to stress out that by if we want

to reach the Paris Agreement reduction goals
of 8095% by 2050, we have to keep almost all

coal into the ground.

Not burning it.

And that means 80% of lignite and hard coal.

Especially hard coal needs to be left in the
ground in order to meet the climate goals.

And that's especially important if we are
facing also the SDGs and this phasing out

coal does have many cobenefits also with the
SDGs.

And we have looked at the individual tradeoffs.

Not only on the phaseout of coal, but also
the phase in of renewables.

And as you can see, the phasein of renewables
brings a lot of benefits on all different

kinds of levels of the SDGs.

But today we talk about phase out of coal.

And that means we have to look at the employment
impacts, electricity prices is crucial.

But also, the local pollution and emissions.

And to our opinion, the best way of phasing
out coal is phasing in renewables.

And especially because we are not alone in
Germany.

I have now the German perspective.

Around us in Europe there are many countries
phasing out coal.

Not only we in Germany as the biggest emitter.

But also, two different countries which are
really important are phasing out also coal.

And around us we see many European countries
sooner or later phasing out individual aspects

of coal.

However, we in Germany are the biggest emitter.

We have the largest amount of emissions.

We have the largest amount of coal.

And this is why we briefly look at two different
countries.

But Germany is crucial here, especially if
we are talking about how to phase out coal.

United Kingdom did an interesting way because
they have 15 gigabyte of coal capacity.

They have a minimum price of coal of CO2 emissions.

And that means they're pretty much reducing
the emissions, but also the share of coal.

Instead, in Germany, we increased the share
of renewables by 2,000.

We have now reached 40% of electricity reduction
but forgot to say to decrease the share of

coal, we still have a very high share of coal
capacity.

Approximately 50 gigawatt.

And depend most of it, import the coal from
international markets.

And this is why it's so crucial to change.

If in Poland, for example, they have similar
issues.

But as in Germany 20 or 25 years ago, the
bad mining conditions are also important.

And this is why we have to look on both aspects.

The local pollution, but also the change of
the energy system in total.

So, now as I wanted to give you a brief overview
of what Germany has decided.

We have 30 years of discussions behind us.

We started with the renewable energy promotion
20 years ago.

But now we have decided to phase out coal
after we will phase out nuclear by 2023.

We phase out coal and now our commission has
decided or also recommended to go this way

further.

And as you can see since the '50s, coal has
been very, very important to the German.

We call it that way.

But those declined since 30 years.

Basically, jobs have been declined.

We started from 50,000 people in the hard
coal sector.

And now 10,000 jobs are left.

And 150,000 in lignite sector, 30,000 are
left.

So, you see, we have already almost done a
long way of structured changes.

But now are doing the rest.

And this is the crucial aspect.

We have these very drastic discussions.

We have a high share of coal, approximately
40% of the electricity system is still based

on coal.

And this is why it's so crucial to change
the whole system.

And now we have recommended to go on different
phases.

The first phase out is to phase out of coal
is to reduce the most inefficient and oldest

coal power plants in the first phase.

Reduce capacities and end coal by 2030 or
2035 at the latest.

The energy sector has a maximum emission budget
left.

And this does not need to be exceeded because
of the Paris target and the reductions we

have to face in emissions.

And the coal, just a few sentences on this,
has a mandate, has a structure to include

all different kinds of people.

Representatives from the government, representatives
from science, from religion.

But also, different stakeholders, NGOs, and
discuss how to do it and how to manage the

coal phase out.

31 members were included into this.

And they had a long debate.

They had a strong debate on how to do it.

And came up with a final report in January
and saying briefly this.

So, we need to on the one hand phase out coal.

They recommended latest by 2035 or 2038.

But also building a strong and sustainable
region by modernizing the energy regions.

And these are the crucial energy regions,
previously coal regions, by increasing infrastructure

and research and modernize the power and energy
sector by increasing the share of renewable

energy and also to increase some gas capacity.

We have some doubts on that.

We think renewables can make it alone.

And also, the vulnerable interest groups or
vulnerable regions need to get some structure

of funds in order to prevent themselves and
also increase their jobs in those regions.

This is pretty much what they said should
be done to go with this line with the phase

out.

And reach the overall target and also to our
opinion, it's not enough just to define the

coal phase out and say how this might be done,
we now need the politicians to act.

And that's quite soon.

I've heard this morning they already said
some sentences in Germany around this.

I think that's very crucial.

And we have different steps to phase.

And this is not a trivial task.

But it's really important to bring this into
the political debate and do the transformation

away from coal towards a sustainable and reasonable
investment towards more renewables.

And this is our main aim for recommendation
to the German government.

We need to go for this compromise.

It has really a major conflict in Germany
which has been solved by this.

But it's not only solved by a coal phase out.

It needs to be solved by a renewable phased
in.

Thanks.

Wonderful.

Thank you very much.

Definitely the best country, so to speak,
to set the stage and this conversation because

it was obviously the biggest news coming out
of the renewable energy space in the last

few weeks, months, I guess.

I'm sure the colleagues on the stage will
have some time to react to what Professor

Kemfert told us.

But I would like to start with you, Minister
Jimenez.

You have declared no new coal power plants.

That is obviously a very interesting move.

You say no new power plants without carbon
capture.

That's the way you phrased it.

And these companies have traditionally volunteered
to start a process to define a voluntary schedule

of a phase out.

That's very interesting as well.

So, I would like you to just take a few moments
to outline the Chilean approach.

Okay.

Thank you very much and thanks for this invitation.

So, we can chair the Chilean experience with
the rest of the panel.

Chile is living a very largescale transformation,
energy transformation.

We used to be a country which was very poor
in energy sources.

We had to import all our fossil fuels.

And thanks to this very dramatic drop in technology
reduction prices of renewable energy, we are

now facing a situation which is very new.

We are very, very rich in the energies of
the present and of the future.

You may know Chile has the highest irradiation
in the northern part.

So, we have big, big potential of solar energy.

But also, of wind energy.

The first geothermal plant from Latin America
is operating in our country and we are constructing

also the first concentrated solar power plant
in the northern part which we will be operating

by 2020.

So, we are now a rich country in energy sources.

And we're living a natural process where we
are replacing or let's say all of the new

investments today are almost all on renewable
energy.

93% of the plants under construction today
are of renewable energy.

But still we have a compromise, an international
compromise to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.

And that's why we want to accelerate this
natural process.

Because energy used to be the problem.

The main source of emissions.

But today it arrives as the main contributor
through decarbonization of not only our electronic

matrix, but also transportation.

So, what we have been doing is we started
as the voluntary agreement between the companies

with coalfired power plants and the minister
industry of energy.

Where, as you said, they compromised not to
construct any further fire coal units unless

they have a capture and storage of CO2.

And also, to have further agreement on a voluntary
schedule of retirement and reconversion of

coalfire power plants.

So, we have been having a conversation around
the table with all those who have something

to say in this process.

This is not only an environmental issue.

It's also a social issue, a labor source.

And it has an economic impact.

And for sure we had to see� be very responsible
with the impact on the efficiency and the

competitiveness of our electric system.

So, we are in the process.

We have had these seven sessions where we
heard all of these perspectives.

Environmental, social, labor, security, economic
point of views.

And we have some preliminary conclusions.

We are on our way to get to this agreement
with each of the four companies that have

coal power plants in Chile.

But we do know that this is a gradual process.

We need time to replace the coal generation
which is still very important in our matrix.

We need to have an accompanying process to
the occupational transition.

And, of course, we may need some adjustments
so as to secure that this huge and increasing

penetration of renewable energy is being done,
taking care of the security and the efficiency

of the electric system.

And, of course, decarbonization, as I said,
is not just electric generation.

It's also transportation.

How we move to low emission transportation.

How we promote energy efficiency.

How we can create new areas like green hydrogen.

So, there's still a lot to do.

But I think we're on a good track.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

Now, I'm definitely hearing an approach where
you are integrating all the issues, you know?

Definitely putting a focus on what we heard
this morning from President Mary Robinson

about energy and energy transition itself
being a human right.

And making sure we don't have, well, understand
where the losers are and make sure they're

looked after, and they're considered as we
transition away from fossil fuels.

So, thank you very much for that.

I'm going to turn to you, Lord Henley.

And obviously you come from the UK.

And the UK is definitely a global leader in
the energy transition.

What is the most important thing that has
helped your country transition safely from

coal to clean energy?

Linda, thank you very much.

And thank you for reminding us that I think
we can't argue that the UK has been a leader

in this process of transition.

Just as sadly, we were the first into coal
200, 250 years ago.

And we saw the growth of coal in the industrial
revolution.

The growth of coal in our economy to the stage
where, by the beginning of the last century

something of the order of a million men were
employed in the coal industry.

And all our power was coming from coal.

Since then, things have changed.

And what I want to do is just speak briefly
about the more recent part of that transition.

And just how much we have to share with the
rest of you in terms of our reduction in use

of coal.

And what the process has been because I think
it has been a real success for the UK.

Going back just a few years, 2012 we were
still generating some 40% of our electricity

from coal.

By last year, 2018, we got that down to 5%.

But in managing that change, this is the important
thing, we've demonstrated that that rapid

transition away from coal is possible whilst
maintaining economic growth and whilst maintaining

security of supply.

Because I think it is of great importance
that industry, our homes, can still be powered

so that people can have warm homes, industry
can still operate.

So, what has driven that rapid transition?

And there have been both social and environmental
aspects at play.

We have had to close uneconomic coal mines,
for instance.

And that has created very definite social
problems.

Gas from the United Kingdom continental shelf
has become available since the 1980s which

has given us certain advantages.

But more important, concerted government action
to change the way we generate our energy has

taken place.

And we've created clear and ambitious targets.

We have now committed to ending unabated coal
power generation by 2025.

And I think that provides certainty for all
of those developing alternative technologies

about future markets.

Secondly, we have been successful in using
financial incentives to move away from coalgenerated

power.

For example, we have introduced the carbon
price support mechanism which is a tax levied

on fossil fuels used to generate electricity.

And that compliments the EU's own emissions
trading system.

Thirdly, we've invested in low carbon technologies
to drive innovation.

We've committed 2.5 billion pounds up to 2021
and placed clean growth at the heart of our

industrial strategy.

Industrial strategy that was published at
the end of 2017 along with clean growth strategy

on producing energy.

And we're particularly interested in the role
that carbon capture usage and storage, CCUS,

can play as well as other technologies such
as hydrogen, other forms of electricity storage

and gasification.

Fourthly, and finally, we've made a real effort
to support renewable energy sources.

And this is driven down costs dramatically,
allowing us to increase their use.

And our offshore wind sector has been a particular
success story and we're now the largest offshore

wind market in the world followed closely
by you in Germany.

Next year we anticipate generating some 10%
of our energy from offshore.

And that's up from a mere 1% in 2010.

And we've set a very ambitious target to generate
a third of all our energy from offshore by

2030.

Now, that is thanks to the hundreds of millions
of pounds of investment in new technologies

leading to costs falling faster than we could
have ever imagined.

One's only got to look at the cost of offshore
wind, how it has plummeted over the years.

Possibly making new investments in other investments
very, very difficult to ever justify.

And it's a good example of the fact that countries
don't need to choose between the idea of growth

and a clean and green economy.

Because offshore wind has created thousands
of jobs in the UK.

And over the next decade I believe it will
create thousands more.

And likewise, overall, we have slashed UK
carbon emissions by some 40% since 1990 whilst,

again, growing the whole economy by over twothirds.

It's only by achieving growth that we can
achieve those cuts in carbon emissions and

provide prosperity to our people.

And I think that's one of the clearest and
most positive measures other nations can take

certainly from our transition away from coal.

It's possible to clean up your energy.

And it's possible to be positive about it.

And it's the best way to cut consumer bills,
drive economic growth and create high value

employment whilst also improving the quality
of life and helping in that international

fight on climate change.

Linda, thank you very much indeed.

Thank you.

Lord Henley, I'm just going to ask a quick
followup question so your comments.

Of the 35% reduction in coal, are you able
to come and specifically how did that get

distributed?

35% reduction in coal use, did all that get
produced by offshore wind?

Did you do hydro?

How did that get absorbed?

We have, obviously, seen a growth in the use
of gas.

We are very lucky to have gas.

But I think gas should be seen as part of
that transition to clean growth along with

the growth in renewables.

But at the same time, I think where we really
do need to do the greatest research is renewables

are going to work only when we've solved the
problem of storage.

And I think it's research into storage, research
into hydrogen

And I've seen some wonderful examples all
around the UK particularly.

In fact, point right up in extreme Orkney
where there is a lot of academic research

going along with the people in Orkney how
they can create hydrogen with wind.

And how that hydrogen, as a means of storing
energy can be used.

And I hope we will see further developments
in that area.

So, gas must be seen as part of the transition
to that clean growth.

But certainly, gas is a lot better than burning
coal.

Thanks.

We'll come back in our second round.

So, Miss Smith, the just transition center,
which you're heading, was founded to secure

the future and livelihoods and workers in
the transition to a low carbon economy and

the dialogue through the process.

We started to have quite a bit that throughout
the day to just make sure there's inclusivity

and it's a peoplecentered transition.

What are your central learnings from exiting
the coal process?

And what have you accompanied in terms of
ensuring what are you accomplished, sorry�

in terms of ensuring a low carbon future while
providing your perspective to those who are

perceived as "Losers" in the process?

If you could expound on that discussion that
started early this morning.

Sure.

Thank you very much.

It's great to hear different perspectives
on coal exit.

I mean, the first thing I want to say is that
we would never call any of our members losers.

Okay.

Right?

Because these are people who have spent their
lives, especially in coal mining, in dangerous

jobs that have kept the lights on.

And now there's no longer a need for the particular
thing that they have been doing.

But that would not necessarily make them a
loser.

Just a small point.

I think the single biggest thing that the
biggest lesson that we're getting from these

different energy transition processes is that
if we only talk about coal exit, we've already

lost.

So, it's a transition out of coal, yes.

But it's a transition to other forms of energy
and even to other sectors of the economy.

And so, if you want this to be successful
as opposed to leaving D industrialized regions

full of dissatisfied people or unemployed
people or people who are suffering financially

or for other reasons, you have to put at least
as much emphasis on the new jobs.

So, what are the plans going to be for workers?

What will the plans and investments be for
regions that today depend on coal?

And you have to do at least as much of that
as you do shutting stuff down.

Because if transition is only about ending
industries and losing jobs, we're not really

going to succeed at getting emissions down
and we will also increase the amount of political

volatility that we see at least in western
countries today.

And this is also why the German Commission's
agreement is so important.

And here I want to echo a bit of what you
said, Professor.

It's really ground breaking.

Because the basis for that agreement which
was negotiated with trade unions at the table.

And indeed, they pushed for a commission like
this.

Is that it ensures that there is a path for
every single worker.

Either to a new good job or to retirement.

And it also ensures a new life for the coaldependent
regions.

Some of which have had no major infrastructure
investment for the last few decades.

The second lesson at least from a labor perspective
is you need organized labor to manage these

transitions.

First, because shutting stuff down is a tough
process for the workers involved.

Someone needs to help workers accept change.

Negotiate for their interests as a group and
make sure that no one is left behind.

And then socialize the agreement and monitor
its implementation.

Which is now happening in Germany, right?

The mining and energy unions are going from
works council to works council and explaining

to members, this what's been negotiated.

This is what it means for you.

These are the next steps.

We have agreed this as in a democratic process.

And that is really the job of unions.

But the flipside of it is is that when you're
building new sectors, such as offshore wind,

you also need unions.

I spent two hours today talking to a senior
person from the UK renewables industry.

And the entire discussion was about skills.

Well, part of it was about skills.

And part of it was about all of the issues
with labor standards in UK renewables right

now.

So, that's everything from wages to health
and safety to certifications.

And one way to get a large workforce with
training certification and skills that can

work at multiple job sites, that can help
you work out health and safety issues, that

is also the job of unions.

So, two quick last things.

I mean, we're seeing now in Canada, in Germany,
in Spain, in the Netherlands, that you can

get agreements for just transition that are
comprehensive and they cover the interests

of workers and to some extent communities
in closing down coal mines and coal fired

power.

It's possible and at a very large scale here
in Germany.

It's harder to get agreements that grow new
jobs and renew regions.

But that is happening as well, and not only
in Germany.

There are a growing number of countries that
are taking this approach of just transition

to their energy transition, but also to other
sectors.

Because it is coming not only to the power
sector, but it's coming to every other sector

as well, just not as quickly.

Thank you.

Excellent.

I appreciate that.

So, finally to you, Minister Turmes, you have
heard a lot from a European perspective.

What are the opportunities of exit call scenarios
and how can innovation drive the process?

so, we didn't have a lot of coal, but what
I can contribute is having 20 years in the

European parliament.

The real success story behind the British
offshore wind was a binding renewable target

for the UK in 2009.

Which there was a lot of opposition at that
time.

But result of the binding renewable target
in the directive of 2009.

I'm pretty sure the UK would never have moved
with such vigor into offshore wind.

And in the years, they were the first to have
competitive bidders, attenders.

So, that was really bringing down the costs.

So, there was an aggressive phase in of renewals
through the legislation.

And what we achieved recently in Europe on
the what we call the clean energy packages,

new targets for renewables in 2030, energy
efficiency targets for 2030.

But equally important, we have introduced
at European scale an environmental performance

standard of 550 gram per kilowatt hour.

Which means it's virtually impossible to build
any new coal power plant in Europe.

And I hope that you understand the magnitude
of our wind when we imposed that.

Again, it's a lot of opposition from certain
countries which are still in coal.

And what is always surprising for me in the
German discussion is the problem of the big

amount of coal in Germany was not necessarily
only German politics.

It was the failure of an energy of an EU E
TS cap and trade policy only.

Already in 2012 it was crystal clear that
there were so many loopholes in the system

that surprise, two certificates would go down
to below ten.

And so, it was evident that gas was largely
available.

Gas power plants in Europe would not run because
they would be basically pushed out from the

merit order by cheap coal.

And that was the coal basically boom in the
whole of Europe and especially in Germany.

So, what is important is that this marketonly
failed in Europe and we basically needed to

be very aggressive in a certain sense legislation.

And so, one pity in the discussion now in
Germany or in Western Europe is the one thing

which the UK really got right was the carbon
floor price.

Which is, I would say, is for liberal or neoliberal
economics it's horror.

It's a massive market intervention.

You put a floor price into a market.

But I would say it's a surprisingly unideological
position in British politics to get a carbon

floor price.

And now my biggest fight in this movement
is getting a carbon floor price, at least

for western Europe.

Because that could accelerate the coal phase
out.

And it's a bit unfortunate that the German
politics have now chosen cash huge cash

to close down coal instead of a system which
would be a bit more British style of carbon

floor pricing.

Carbon floor price for Western Europe would
probably have driven coal even faster out.

So, we have to be tough on coal.

And we have to prevent any new coal investments
in Europe.

But and I like very much your intervention,
we have to be extremely respectful for any

person who has worked in coal.

It's a tough job.

It's a dangerous job.

So, these people have often paid with their
lives or it's and these regions, we have

to help them.

And therefore, the other thing where I'm quite
proud of is that we got in the collective

work between the European parliament and some
member states and the European Commission

a cotransition, an energy transition fund
where we have financial to move out of coal.

Where we help areas move out.

Where we will help Greece to transition.

And that is what is really important.

And it's more than money.

It's also about having a pool of experts all
over Europe and also maybe sometimes flying

in some world experts on what are concrete
ideas for a region which was in coal.

Because it's more than money.

You need to know, what do you do in this region.

And I like that part of the German coal agreement.

You have to strengthen civil society.

When you get when you tell a region where
you were and what you were used to is over.

This I come if you would go to a person
and you say it's what you have done for

the last 30 or maybe 200 years is over, you
risk being in the depression.

You can't have collective depression.

I think.

So, you need to trigger a positive social
mood in these regions.

And I think that's our duty to do it.

And to finish, I think that we have said something
very important at this moment.

We need a sense of urgency.

Not only to move quickly into renewables.

We need a sense of urgency to close down coal
power plants which are hardly five or eight

or 10 or 15 years old.

And that puts, I think, on the agenda of the
international climate negotiations.

If we want coal power plant the in Indonesia
to be closed down, and I think we have to,

because otherwise we are just cheating ourselves.

Somebody must put money on the table.

The problem today is no more on paying more
renewables because they are damn cheap and

that is our success.

Solar in Africa you get it.

You put a bit of your risk in money, it will
fly.

Everywhere wind will fly.

Everywhere offshore wind will fly.

The money today is I think to help certain
countries, certain regions to dare to phase

out existing coal.

That is what we will have to do.

Thank you very much.

Thank you very much for those interventions.

I think I'm just getting a theme of our conference
here.

Number had one, political will.

You know, I'm really getting that was echoed
by the audience in the previous poll.

We're hearing our experts.

People have definitely put a lot of thought
into this subject.

That we have to decide, as a society, politically
how the legislation and really go after it.

So, that's the first thing that I'm hearing.

Secondly, I'm hearing there's investment that
is required.

And thirdly, I'm also hearing that the people's
sight of it, you know, the human sight of

it, has to be front and center.

We have to consider all the stakeholders as
we are transitioning away from coal and certainly

other fossil fuels.

Right?

But that's that's kind of what I'm getting
from the discussion right now.

But I want us to really bring you in as the
audience.

And if you haven't participated already, I
feel inclined to discuss the questions with

you because the second part of this panel
we are going to be responding to your thoughts

as par.

Before I call Mr.Dialogue here, the questions
that we're asking are, in your opinion, what

are the most important aspects in the exit
coal discussion?

Are we talking about reduction in CO2 emissions?

Are we talking about endangerment of jobs
as we just heard?

Are we talking about intervention in nature
through coal mining or strengthening of renewable

energies?

What is the most important aspect in your
opinion?

The other question is I think an interesting
one.

It's a simple yes or no answer.

Would you be prepared to pay a higher price,
a higher electricity price for exiting coal?

So, this brings down to the challenge that
we were given this morning.

What are you doing personally to help the
energy transition?

And then finally, talking to the urgency,
right?

We just heard that the UK did it in five years.

In which period do you see exit compatible
and realizable.

I've made it easy.

Get on to the QR code as I call my colleague,
Mr. Dialogue to help us.

I thought we agreed on Dr. Dialogue.

No, you've got to earn the Ph.D. You've got
to learn it.Mr.Dialogue: Everyone is familiar

with the QR code.

I would like to switch over to Tweets before
we look at the result there is.

Some of you may be familiar with Euractiv,
another company that gets a lot of good news.

And one thing I learned is we have people
here from more than 50 countries, which is

quite impressive.

Writing that the coal exit has many benefits.

Citing Claudia.

And if you're not sure what coal benefits
are, there's a booth out there.

The IASS has a booth over there.

And they have Tweeted about benefits.

And you can ask them if you're not sure.

And they can tell you about it.

And the director of the ISE, Europe's largest
photovoltaics.

There he is, waving up to us.

And he also agrees there's a lack of a sense
of urgency among some of the speakers here.

And finally, I have a Tweet to Linda.

I don't know if you can see this, but she's
got a stack of cards.

And that's just for this panel.

She's got a stack for every panel.

She did her homework.

She's got like questions for every person
for the who two days.

She must have written a book just preparing
for all of this.

And she's not only got this microphone on,
but she's got an ear piece.

I don't know if you can see that, so that
somebody over here can whisper into her ear.

Linda, speed it up, we're behind schedule.

And during all that have, she has to concentrate
on what they're saying.

So, I would like to quote Tina here who basically
says, Linda, thanks for the great moderation.

Thank you very much.

God bless.

I'm not quite finished though.

Not quite finished, though.

Now I need the clicker thing.

While he gets his clicker, it would be remiss
of me to take all the credit.

There was a team that prepared me.

The team from BSW and everywhere else.

They prepared me.

So, really it is a team effort and we will
recognize them a bit more tomorrow.

Thank you very much.

All right.

So, let's see what the results are here.

I can barely read the fine print there.

So, the most important aspect in the coal
exit discussion is the reduction of carbon

emissions in this group's opinion.

Some people are still voting.

But we'll continue.

Would you be prepared to pay a higher electricity
price for exiting coal?

Almost all of you would.

But when I saw this question I thought, yeah.

We have the money, most of us, right?

The real challenge is, as we've also heard
up here, what about the people who aren't

doing so well?

And finally, in which period do you consider
a coal exit compatible?

Or realizable?

About 50% within the next ten years.

All right.

So, we have some results there.

I'll pass that on to the panel.

And thank you very much.

Thank you very much, Mr. Dialogue.

Thank you.

So, panel, at this point I'm really going
to put it out to the floor to react to the

poll.

What you're hearing, to some of the Tweets.

And to also underscore perhaps a comment you
have heard from your colleagues.

Continue their discussion about their experiences
from your own country.

I want us to interact with each other.

Make it a bit more lively.

I want to start with you, Professor Kemfert
what you have just heard from the audience.

Thank you very much.

As I said in the very beginning, I said the
coal exit strategy in Germany is one example

how to also solving a major conflict with
the different social groups.

And you already mentioned that hard workers,
the coal jobs are very important.

But as I said, we already have done a structured
change.

We started with 600,000 people in those areas.

Especially in Western Germany and have done
sometimes very good, sometimes a little bit

could be improved structured change of those
areas.

But now we have this situation in Eastern
Germany where our structure lacks and there

are some areas where people do not really
find a job.

They have really difficulties in finding a
new job.

And this is to answer Claude's comment, that
we have to spend money for those areas where�

where they have to be improved infrastructure.

Where they need some financial payments also
for improving the situation, bringing it

attractive situations to companies to those
people in order to really improve the situation

for new and innovative jobs in transition.

And renewable energy for sure is one part
of it.

But it's also research and development.

We need innovation in those areas.

And also, energy efficiency improvement.

Hydrogen has been mentioned, new storage options.

There's a lot of research ongoing in these
areas as well.

And this is why it's so important to focus
on both.

On the one hand, how to reduce emissions,
how to change the energy system towards more

renewables, less coal.

But also bringing the sectors together with
renewables also not only in the electricity,

but also mobility and building sector.

And on the other hand, how to increase the
jobs and innovation.

And we're talking about the social implications.

And I think both could be perfectly included
in a coal phase out strategy if we are doing

it in a clever way.

And Germany, of course, could have done a
floor price on CO2.

But this would have been enormously high,
4060 Euros per ton of CO2 which we would have

never seen.

But right now, they could have started earlier
and really doing the coal phase out and also

offering opportunities, innovations to the
most affected regions.

So, I think it's a combination not only to
improving the situation for companies for

investment, but also for R&D and innovation.

And here in the eastern part in Germany we
have and we could look at all over the

world, I think.

In almost all areas where coal mining is happening
to bring new jobs, to bring new innovation.

To really go for those regions who are affected
most and offer opportunities and we in Germany,

of course, we could offer those.

And I think this coal commission has done
a tremendous job in offering those opportunities.

But now the politicians have to react as well.

So, I think it could be it could be a role
model for the world if we do it right.

It could be not a role model if we are messing
it up.

It would be now a good chance to show that
we could do a coal phase out.

Fantastic.

Thank you for that.

I just to want bring in an aspect here that
we touched on at the beginning, but I really

want us to deep dive.

And I'm gonna be maybe I'm just going it
be a little bit invulnerable here.

The second question, would you pay more for
green electricity.

It's obvious with this audience.

Yeah, of course I will.

But I don't know that I will.

I live in Kenya.

I already pay 2030 cents a kilowatt hour for
unreliable electricity.

Electricity that goes down.

That is not an obvious answer for me.

And I obviously represent a big economic class.

I cannot think of my brothers and sisters
back in Kenya who would say, of course, I'm

going to pay more for green electricity because
I understand the implications and things like

that.

Obviously, there's an awareness piece and
all that.

But at the end of the day, affordability is
critical, right?

You cannot sell expensive things to poor people.

And I'm not suggesting that Africa as a block
is poor.

But if I have to think twice about whether
I would, without a thought, pay for a more

expensive electricity, you know, how do we
think about that?

Because we are thinking about a transition,
remember, that leaves no one behind.

We talked about 51% of unelectrified people
in our continent.

We talked about 3 billion people who don't
have access to cooking energy.

We talked about 1.3 billion people around
the globe that do not have access to energy.

So, affordability is something that we really
cannot skimp if we ask about a just transition.

Perhaps should have the minister Jimenez want
to say something.

And then over to you, Lord Henley.

I want to take your words.

Even if we have all the common objectives,
which is democratization, in this case, one

size doesn't fit all.

We have different contexts.

Different conditions.

For example, you have gas for your transition.

We don't.

We do have renewable energy that's a blessing.

We do have 40% of our matrix with coalfired
power plants, which is not very usual.

It's quite high.

It's like yours, but not the average of the
alliance for phase out of coal.

We have a park that is of plants, of carbon
units that is 12 years old.

Not 45 like UK, not 25 like Germany.

And I don't think that everybody can afford
to pay more.

So, even if I agree that the questioncarbonization,
the main objective is to reduce emission,

that's why we're talking about this, it's
inevitable to say that there's so many interrelated

elements.

Labor and how to reconvert people in other
activities.

How does this affect the efficiency of the
system, meaning prices?

Competitiveness of poorer countries.

How do we consider that not all countries
have the same electricity intensity use because

it's different to reduce intensity and be
efficient when you have double, twice, I mean,

four times ten times the consumption
of other countries?

So, I think the objective is the same.

But there is no not a unique path, not
a unique speed to reach the objectives where

we all want to go.

Thanks.

Thank you.

Well, could I just add one thing.

We're all agreed, all of us in this room,
about the absolute fundamental importance

of reducing emissions.

We are not going to persuade the public, the
consumer, everybody else who isn't in this

room about the virtues of that by increasing
the cost of energy.

And one thing that's going to put people off,
it's suddenly having to pay more.

And they are more likely to listen to siren
voices saying this is not necessary.

This change is not happening.

So, we have a duty obviously, to try to subsidize
some forms of renewable energy.

Try to put money into research so that we
can see that continuing process that we have

seen with the costs I just mentioned, offshore
wind, where the cost has plummeted.

But I think the same is true of solar.

Not something that the United Kingdom is ever
going to be completely dependent on solar.

But other countries will have an interest
in solar.

But again, we have seen the price of solar
come down as the greater use of it's been

made by a means of subsidies by governments
in one form or another.

But it won't happen if the individual consumer
is going to have to pay more.

At the same time, we also and this is where
government intervention will be necessary

we will have to and that's why I mentioned
the 2 billion or so that we're putting into

these things to put money into means of
storing electricity.

Because quite obviously renewables, most renewables
are fairly intermittent and don't work.

So, more has to be done in terms of storage.

That might mean more has to be done in hydrogen.

I'm a believer that hydrogen might be the
future for storage.

But more has to be done, for example, in making
our grids both within country and across borders

smarter in terms of moving electricity around
so that we will use it more efficiently.

There are a whole host of areas where we can
make progress.

We can use our energy more effectively.

We've all seen that over the generations.

With each new car we buy, it is more efficient
than the previous one.

Just as our airplanes get more efficient.

We in the UK I know could do a great deal
more about insulating a lot of our domestic

housing.

So, we use electricity.

And I admire what the position Germany has
got to where I have to say, insulation is

much better.

And as a result, I think people well, certainly
much better, I can say, than the United Kingdom.

But but anyway.

All of us can make progress in that field.

But I don't think we should think we can solve
the problem by saying I want to pay more for

my electricity.

Because people will not like that.

And people will be turned off.

The whole greater aim of reducing our carbon
footprint.

Thank you.

Thank you for that.

Appreciate it.

Appreciate that comment for sure.

So, as you said, the point of a just transition
is not just that it benefits workers, but

also that it alleviates poverty.

And poverty is a structural issue.

So, it's not a question about the willingness
of individuals to pay or not pay as we were

commenting on the poll.

But it is also about the what the power
sector, what options they have if they have

access to energy.

Whether they are priced out of access to energy.

What kinds of incomes people have?

And it's also about the systemic issue of
tax and income distribution.

So, for example, in many countries you have
an extractive sector which has extracted labor

and commodities from the country over a period
of decades or sometimes a century or more.

And that means that there are pockets of wealth
in that sector.

For example, in the mining sector or in the
oil and gas sector.

But it's not distributed amongst the people
who are living in the country.

So, some of these issues about the price of
energy are also issues about the fair distribution

of first of the benefits of resource extraction.

But also, of the benefits of access to power.

And thinking about this in particular because
I recently returned from South Africa where

you have a mining and industrial complex that
uses 60 plus percent of the country's electricity.

You still have, despite some very good efforts
by the government, a large number of people,

especially in rural areas, who do not have
access to electricity.

And you have a group of people who recently
since the fall of apartheid have gotten axe

to electricity, but now the price is shooting
up.

Right?

In that situation some of the questions that
you might need to ask, and I just say this

as an observer, are, who is benefiting or
extracting value from this electricity?

Who is making the most profit from it and
therefore could probably pay the most to transform

the system or it maintain it?

And who needs income redistribution in order
to be able to afford electricity which is

a right?

Right?

So, those would be those would be some
of the questions.

You would also have to look at the just transition
of the power sector the issues for workers

for communities.

Because one road for people out of poverty
is actually decent jobs.

But also, those issues about fair tax and
fair distribution of revenues.

Thank you.

Very thoughtful.

Thank you very much.

Would you like to add to that?

So, I don't like these kind of questions,
do you want to pay more for organic or for

having a clean world?

At the end of the day, I may be a bit radical,
climate change is not the hobby of someone.

Sorry, it is the biggest societal challenge
for all of us.

And the second thing which I think we have
an economic system in which pollution is not

pain.

So, I will never have an as low kilowatt
price as coming from a system that is coal

powered.

I'm a bit cautious to get public attention
fixed on price per kilowatt hour electricity.

We will lose.

It's impossible to do the energy transition
out of heavy coal.

You will have to increase your price per kilowatt
hour.

I have some economics.

It's not possible.

So, what we have to do is, and by the way,
I don't think that will have such a large

impact.

All studies I have seen, there is energy poverty.

Often energy poverty is poverty full stop.

So, I think we need to do antipoverty policies.

And then when you look more the biggest
energy poverty is not in electricity consumption.

It is in transport.

Poor people have no car.

No money to pay a car.

So, public transport maybe free public transport.

That's more important for energy poverty.

And since the second biggest issue is bad
insulated houses.

And what is our problem?

Most of our energy efficiency policies, at
least in Europe, is done for upper middle-class

people.

Who read very complicated messages on the
Internet.

Where we say to them, oh, go and insulate.

And to have cash on the shelf.

Poor people don't have cash on the shelf.

So, what we need if we are really serious
about energy poverty, and I have won the battle

in Europe.

Europe in the new governance regulation where
I was a rapporteur, every country will in

the energy and climate plan needs a chapter
on energy poverty so we will force governments

to report and then what I hope to get out
of that is, targeted energy efficiency policies

for those low income population who don't
have money to renovate their buildings.

We need other these people will never be
able to renovate a building out of themselves.

So, I think it's energy poverty is too serious
to just be a bit of a slogan.

You need to dig deeper into it.

And I don't know do we get to search around
or is that my last?

Because I have one other important message.

I will definitely give you your parting shot.

I will give you another chance, sir.

Then I stop here.

The poll questions I designed to bring certain
aspects.

The first one I want to echo what Lord Henley
said.

The people in this room, it was so obvious
that the number one thing you do about exiting

coal is you reduce your CO2 emissions.

Very obvious.

In another forum, the second aspect, the endangerment
of jobs would be another aspect of it.

Providing a bit of a disconnect and alignment
and motivation.

I just wanted to make that as a comment.

We've obviously talked about the affordability
thing which captured the second poll question.

I want to frame the third poll question for
discussion and then go into the lightning

round.

I was a little surprised because this of all
audiences has an understanding of the IPCC

report that says we've got how many years?

12 years?

Before climate change is irreversible.

I'm getting signals here.

There's a gentleman who is understanding what
we're saying.

Yet we're saying, yeah, we'll take ten years
to exit coal.

And we also saw Mr. Birol's presentation
this morning that says, if we can just look

at the emissions for the already installed
factories and uses.

If we just look at that, then we're going
to make a lot more progress.

But here we are in a room of experts and highly
influential people that think we actually

have ten years to exit coal and it's not more
urgent than we might think.

And might look at the example from the UK.

So, again, so, why do we think we still have
time?

I don't understand that?

Why is this not an urgent issue?

Anybody?

It's really urgent.

I think and you see some of the urgency reflected
in the path that you have countries or provinces

basically shutting down stuff that is still
commercially viable, right?

So, we are at a point where renewable energy
is cheaper.

We do have) with storage.

There are some issues with grid improvement.

But nonetheless, if you're looking at the
total cost, it's probably easier to keep some

of these plants running or more commercially
reasonable to do it.

Than to shut them down and build new stuff.

And that is one indicator of the urgency.

I would say from a labor movement perspective;
the other indicator of urgency is probably

the absolute worst part of being a union leader
is telling people that they're going to lose

their jobs, or their jobs are going to disappear,
or their jobs are going to change very substantially.

And maybe not for the better.

And, yet, at least my job, I daily meet union
leaders who are ready to take on the hard

discussion about the energy transition or
transition in other sectors.

It is coming.

It is very urgent.

Some of the speed we do not control.

But it is much better to be a part of the
discussion to be at the negotiating table

and to be able to get good jobs and future
the for our members than it is to, you know,

get the short end of the deal once the decision
is made.

So, is it fast enough?

It depends how fast we go in other sectors.

But so far, we're not moving fast enough.

Ink we can all agree on that.

Yeah.

We really need to act fast for sure.

We have the last 20 years of discussion.

And here is the problem.

Because we have a global problem.

But we need local solutions.

And this is why it's so difficult to find
a way out of it.

And in those countries like Germany which
have a really large share of coal, we all

have the debate about affordability, about
jobs, about social aspects.

And you need this time for discussion.

And you need the time for solutions.

But at the end of the day we all have to act.

The good thing here is that renewables become
cheaper and cheaper.

And that's the question to the affordability
as well.

Because for poorer households, most often
gas and oil is much more expensive than renewables.

This is not only true in Germany, but other
areas of the world.

Solar is becoming cheaper and cheaper in Africa.

You can use solar everywhere.

And also new jobs are created.

Affordability is solved.

So, I think we have the solution already on
the table, which is renewables, and just go

for it.

And we need the framework for that.

And don't wait for global nations, for all
the global current price or whatever is mentioned.

We can act now.

And that's not so complicated just to change.

But the economics are very clear renewables
are becoming cheaper and cheaper.

And the investment must go into it.

The framework must be adjusted that the investment
can be made, and market barriers are removed

and that's pretty much it.

But there we can go for it.

And that's a good I would say it's a good
message to all of us that we have the solution

on the table.

Okay.

Thank you.

Lord Henley, did you have anything to add
having heard all these interventions as we're

sort of coming to the last little section
of our panel here.

And it comes down to that question as to whether
we think following the most recent report

of the IPCC whether we are going fast enough.

I can obviously only talk about what we've
achieved in the UK and hope that gives an

indication of encouragement we would like
to give to the rest of the world.

Yes, we have made considerable progress.

Yes, we would like to do more.

I can just add for Claude who suggested this
was a result of the directive in 2009.

Remind him that we did, a year earlier, in
2008, pass our climate change act.

One of those rare acts of parliament that
you might find difficult to believe in current

circumstances where we had all parties on
the side.

That act went through unopposed, binding targets
on the United Kingdom government of whatever

persuasion it was followed by the then labor
government, by the coalition government now

by the current conservative government.

Targets taking us up to 2030 which we're on
the way to meeting, difficult though they

might be.

And we want to then look at those and decide
what the target should be to take us on to

2050.

And get down to, say, 80% of where we were
in 1990.

We are making progress.

We want to do more.

And we want to encourage more.

I think we have to do a lot of that by what
I have been talking about.

Seeing to developments in renewables.

Some of those we might find we go down the
wrong path.

Not every renewable turns out to be as good
as another.

Also looking at that crucial question of storage
of electricity which I think is the vital

one to get renewables working.

And again, it might be we go down the wrong
route in that.

I do not know.

I just happen to think that hydrogen is possibly
the way we can do that.

But always remember, everyone makes mistakes.

Some things will be wrong.

But in the end, we will get to the right conclusion
and we will get to something that provides

us with cheaper and more reliable and cleaner
power for our people, for their homes, and

for the industry that we need for growth.

Excellent.

Excellent.

Did you want to add to that before I hand
it over to Minister Turmes?

Yes.

Just to have some cautions.

Because it's not that the there's no not
an urgency on looking for a solution for the

climate impact, the climate change impact,
but there's some restrictions.

And that may be what delays the change.

Of course, renewable energy unfortunately
are very cheap and very competitive.

But still you have to replace the whole coalfired
power plant generation with new investments

in new generation.

But not only that, you also need to have more
transmission infrastructure which not always

is so easy.

I live in a very thin and long country where
our potential is in the north and we need

to bring it to the south.

And that means lines that are over 10 00 kilometers.

you need that infrastructure because you not
only need to replace that generation, but

you have to bring it to the consumer centers.

There is where on the one side I see an opportunity
for collaboration.

Even when I have a faster transition in other
countries and probably in less developed countries.

There must be an international collaboration.

And also, I think we have to work on one side
I totally agree on research which will allow

this progress.

Because at the end what really, really made
the change was this marvelous reduction of

prices of renewable energies.

We didn't have tariffs.

We are grateful that you did so that we could
take advantage of that technology for very

competitive prices now.

But we do need to have more research because
we also have to deal with the variable generation

of this kind of sources like wind and solar
and photovoltaic.

And we need more storage.

We need water bumping; we need other technologies
that can join this variable generation and

allows to do that transition as fast as possible.

But I do have to sign out, we have these restrictions
which we need to deal with.

And certainly, I also think we have to work
on economic instruments which let us trade

emission reductions so that we can, again,
help those countries who don't have maybe

the resources and that we all achieve this emission
reductions in the world.

But by financing other projects in other parts
of the world.

Thank you.

Fantastic.

Before I hand it over to you, I just have
to comment that I've learned so much today

in terms of I guess a different challenge
base the on the geography of the different

countries.

We heard from the Maldives minister; he's
talking about a country that's 3 miles top

to bottom.

We heard from the Chinese minister that she's
talking about transmitting 5,000 kilometers

top to bottom and now learning about Chile
that's transmitting, you know, 10,000 miles.

Very, very interesting.

Indeed, one size does not fit all.

Yeah.

Thank you very much.

Your question was, why didn't we grasp that
we had to go faster?

For me personally the moment was, I would
say, two, three years ago when I ran for the

parliament a scenario based for the first
time on the carbon budget.

I think what we really have to understand
is, climate is about volume of greenhouse

gases emitted.

So, you don't grasp anything as long as you
do not put numbers on what is the budget you

are still allowed to spend?

That I think is the UK politics was very early
on the right track.

And we now I think the good thing is again
in this governance regulation we pushed the

European Commission to define a carbon budget
for Europe.

What is left?

And then you see that you can't fly flat.

And then deep quickly.

That is not sustainable.

So, you then you understand you have to do
it earlier.

And the other important thing is we have to
do back casting scenarios from net zero.

And, of course, today we speak about 2050.

Sometimes I'm not sure if 2050 is really as�
if we can go to as long as that.

But you have to do back casting to understand
that, for example, in the car industry, we

would have to phase out fossil cars probably
in 2030.

Because they have a 30year lifetime.

So, it's about everybody needs a carbon budget.

And everybody needs to do back casting.

Otherwise the society and policy makers will
not understand the urgency.

Luckily, we have now pushed at least the European
countries into that.

The good news is, and I think Claudia has
mentioned it, we have managed.

So, all the solutions get cheap, PV is cheap,
offshore wind is cheap, onshore wind is cheap,

batteries.

Batteries we'll make with electric cars will
be cheap.

And that is what is encouraging.

So, maybe we lost some time.

But the good news is, now we are in a situation
to move quick.

And, of course, grid building takes time.

But then we can learn from certain countries.

And we have, for example, batteries can replace
some line building.

So, but the good news is we can move quick.

And then we have one last really big problem.

That's the financial community.

It's the banks who make the world move into
coal or out of coal.

So, we have banks like the agent development
bank which is not very clear where they stand

on coal.

I find it a bit strange that we have a G20
in Japan.

And, of course, we can't have discussions
on hydrogen with Japan.

I think the discussion on the G20 has to be,
no export credit agency.

And even not the Japanese anymore are allowed
to sponsor coal power plants.

That is the decisive G20 decision discussion
which has been.

And so, we really need and I say it coming
from my biggest footprint in Luxembourg is

not the cargo and whatever, it's my financing
center in Luxembourg.

We are, like London, like Zurich, like Dublin
we are a trillion dollar or yuan collecting

machines.

It's our damned duty to change these financial
centers from black into green.

And I think that's something which we have
to move still on.

Brilliant.

Tough act to follow.

So, I am just going to call no, what can
I say?

I completely 100% agree.

So, one last time, I'm going to ask Mr. Dialogue
to let us know what is out on Twitter.

This is the last session of the day.

And then we will close quickly with a lightning
round.

So, think about what do you want the audience
to go out with?

They attended the exit call.

Challenges and solution.

I think that's what we are called managing
the socioeconomic implications of exit coal

strategies.

So, your final round on your parting thoughts.

And then we're going go and have our evening
reception.

So, Mr. Dialogue, what is the world telling
us?

Well, we have one who has a great exchange
on developments in the regional and global

landscape.

Meeting with Simonetta as we saw earlier on
today.

She was on one of our panels here.

And we also have let's see.

We have the world energy council also talking
about sector coupling.

And talking to us about that as well.

Thank you very much.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Appreciate that.

Okay.

So, the last sort of round.

You know your parting shot for the day and
then I will explain the evening program.

Okay.

Starting with Professor Kemfert and then we'll
go right down the seating.

Prof. Kemfert: Thanks so much.

I very much appreciated this discussion.

It was enjoyable to stay here and discuss
with you about the coal phase out sop, I'm

pretty much sure that Germany is now in the
focus of showing that the coal phase out in

Germany is feasible.

We can make it by clear signals.

We have the coal committee giving a report
and giving recommendations.

We should now let the politicians act in Germany
and make a good deal out of it.

Go for structured changes as innovation and
those regions mostly are factored.

And we have the sector coupling heard.

We have the socioeconomic implications.

And you can combine all of this because the
solutions are not only technological with

renewable energy and sector coupling and storage
which we have heard, but also to Brit people

on board.

And here I think in those areas, especially
in eastern Germany, it's quite crucial to

have a narrative and to show the people that
there are solutions, there are new jobs.

We go not only for climate protection, but
we go for a future that is sustainable.

And here you could be a role model for the
world in bringing those technologies in and

bringing also the people on board and show
that it's feasible.

And I think the answer, again, is not only
phase out coal, it's a phasein renewables.

And that's that's sustained with the transition.

We can go.

We can show and also make it successful way
out of.

And thanks again for having me here.

Thank you.

Phase out coal and phase in renewables.

Your parting shot, Minister Jimenez?

Thank you a allot.

It's a privilege to be here and listen to
other experiences.

I would like to emphasize what I said before.

There's no single path.

Even though we are all working into the same
direction.

I think there are anyway some transverse lessons
that we can identify.

I think it's important, all countries have
done it and sometimes you want to go faster.

We have to be responsible.

Especially with the security of the system,
of the electric system.

And the multiple interrelated elements that
have to be considered by deciding our own

pathway.

And typically, the renewable energies of the
future.

We have to look for further applications,
not only in electric generation, but also

in heating and cooling and in industrial uses.

And so, I think there's a promising future.

And I'm glad that we are all speaking the
same language in that direction.

Thank you.

Fantastic.

Mr., many factors to into this transition.

Sir.

Well, thank you very much.

I agree with both of those interventions.

I'm almost tempted to add, let a thousand
flowers bloom.

But I think I might be misunderstood in using
a Maoist comment of that sort.

But I think it's right and proper that we
look at a whole range of different alternatives

in renewables.

Because this is one where one size does not
fit all.

There are a whole lot of options according
to which country you are, whether you have

a continental shelf.

And therefore, offshore wind makes sense or
whether onshore is more appropriate.

Whatever.

Those are just examples.

Similarly, there will be a whole range of
different options for storage of electricity.

Some countries will have the option of using
pumped hydro to store it.

Others won't.

It, again, depend on the shape of their country
and what they've got.

There is much that we can do.

There is a great deal of research that we,
as governments, must also commit to.

And I give my commitment that we will continue
with that.

But I think that last point that I wanted
to make is how vital it is.

And I think I'm echoing both of you here.

Is that this is something that we must take
people with us on.

And go back to that original question about,
would you be happy to see the cost of your

energy go up?

It is all fine and dandy for people like us
to say it will go up.

But if we lose the support of other people
in our own countries, or other people throughout

the world, we are not going to win the hearts
and minds to win the battle against climate

change.

Thank you.

I agree.

Yes.

Brilliant.

Yes.

So, one thing we haven't discussed which I
think is quite important not only for the

agreement in Germany, buts where, is that
we're able to find democratic solutions to

some very difficult problems.

And I want to echo something I've heard from
my German sisters and brothers, it's also

a victory for democracy.

That you've managed to land a difficult, maybe
intractable problem in a way that combines

a lot of different interests.

The second thing that we have discussed a
little bit is that we actually need much better

jobs in renewables than the ones we have today.

Because if you want to persuade people that
it's okay to phase out one highemitting industry

and phase in another, then the job quality
has to be equivalent, right?

Otherwise it's a very difficult argument to
make.

So, we need better labor standards in renewables,
and we could get them.

And the last two things are that in the labor
movement we like to say that there are no

jobs on a dead planet.

But also, that we must leave no one behind.

And we're starting to get evidence from these
different processes, not only in Germany,

but in Canada, Spain, the Netherlands and
elsewhere that in fact you can have both things.

You can have good jobs on a living planet.

And you can also leave no one behind.

Yes.

Wow.

Go on.

It's a good moment to move.

Technologies we have I think a big amount
of political experience in this country and

that country on the whole.

We move forward.

And it's, of course, always important to keep
this it's not about only political majorities,

it's about societal majorities to move the
show.

And then I would say let's be impatient optimists. Thank you.

Wonderful.

Thank you very much.

Would you join me in thanking the panel here?
