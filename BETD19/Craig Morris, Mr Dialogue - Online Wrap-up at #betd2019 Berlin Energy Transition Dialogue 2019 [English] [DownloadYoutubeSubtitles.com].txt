First of all, for the past two days, everybody who has been walked on the stage has been looking straight at a robot.

All these panels have been whispering, what's
that robot doing over there?

Now we know.

Nobody knew.

They were asking me. I didn't know either.

Can I get, before I present you with some
of the summary of the social media activity,

can I get the picture of the roof terrace,
please?

So, I promised you this in the last session
if you were there.

The German whoops.

Can we get that back?

The German is it up again?

It's gone now.

It's there.

The German energy agency posted this.

So, if you were not able to take part in the
women's lunch, for whatever reason, you can

try to get up there again sometime because
the view of the city from the roof terrace

is really fantastic.

But let's move on now to the summary of the
statistics.

Oh, I just have to press this.

Let's see.

Pressing, pressing, pressing.

Technology.

So, we said that we had 60% female speakers.

Yes. Please.

That's quite an accomplishment in the energy sector.

I have been to trade shows where the only
women were working at some of the booths or

something.

So, this is quite an accomplishment.

60%.

You can see here that we had these are
the two days the two bump there is are

the two days of activity with the #BETD2019.

We had quite an impact there.

We also had a similar impact with Energiewende you see
three days there.

The first day there is kind of a normal load.

And so, we sort of doubled or tripled the
discussion about the Energiwende.

We have a word cloud here on the left for
the hashtags that were used.

My favorite one, if you look closely, for
some reason this is what people were Tweeting

along with BETD 2019.

Who was Tweeting national unicorn day?

You did it?

Okay.

Tweeted it a bunch of times to get it up there.

And then the keyword cloud on the right.

I didn't see anything that funny over there,
though.

The region and demographics.

You can see we have quite an international
outreach here.

It's pretty impressive.

Over on the right, the breakdown of men and
women Tweeting.

And here we've got 64% men, but believe me,
for Twitter, especially in the energy sector,

that's still good.

It's usually about 80% to 20%.

All right.

So, thank you.

This is the last time I'll be seeing you.

So, it was a pleasure.

And Linda, I'll hand off to you now.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.
